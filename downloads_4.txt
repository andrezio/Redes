TI Realization of a near-perfect antireflection coating for silicon solar
   energy utilization
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB To harness the full spectrum of solar energy, Fresnel reflection at the surface of a solar cell must be eliminated over the entire solar spectrum and at all angles. Here, we show that a multilayer nanostructure having a graded-index profile, as predicted by theory [J. Opt. Soc. Am. 66, 515 (1976); Appl. Opt. 46, 6533 (2007)], can accomplish a near-perfect transmission of all-color of sunlight. An ultralow total reflectance of 1%-6% has been achieved over a broad spectrum, lambda=400 to 1600 run, and a wide range of angles of incidence, theta=0 degrees-60 degrees. The measured angle- and wavelength-averaged total reflectance of 3.79% is the smallest ever reported in the literature, to our knowledge. (C) 2008 Optical Society of America

TI Near-infrared quantum cutting in transparent nanostructured glass
   ceramics
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Quantum cutting downconversion involving the emission of two near-infrared photons for each blue photon absorbed is realized in transparent glass ceramics with embedded Pr3+/Yb3+: beta-YF3 nanocrystals. On excitation of Pr3+ ions with a visible photon at 482 nm, Yb3+ ions emit two near-infrared photons at 976 nm through an efficient cooperative energy transfer from Pr3+ to Yb3+, with optimal quantum efficiency close to 200%. The development of the near-infrared quantum cutting transparent glass ceramic could open a route to enhance the energy efficiency of the silicon solar cell by converting one blue solar photon to two near-infrared ones.

TI "Quantum coaxial cables" for solar energy harvesting
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Type II core-shell nanowires based on III-V and II-VI semiconductors are designed to provide the highly desirable but not readily available featureefficient charge separationand concurrently address the different material challenges specific for a few key renewable energy applications: including hydrogen generation via photoelectrochemical water splitting, dye-sensitized solar cells, and conventional solar cells. They also open up new avenues for studying novel physics and material sciences in reduced dimensionality of very unusual quasi-one-dimensional systems. A first-principles density function theory within the local density approximation (LDA) is used for the electronic structure calculation and a valence-force-field method for the strutural relaxation, and emprical corrections to the LDA errors are applied.

TI Model for fermion masses and lepton mixing in SO(10) x A(4)
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The discrete flavor symmetry A(4) explains very well neutrino data at low energy, but it seems difficult to extend it to grand unified models since, in general, left-handed and right-handed fields belong to different A(4) representations. Recently a model has been proposed where all the fermions equally transform under A(4). We study here a concrete SO(10) realization of such a model providing small neutrino masses through the see-saw mechanism. We fit the charged fermion masses run up to the unification scale. Some fermion masses properties come from the SO(10) symmetry while lepton mixing angles are a consequence of the A(4) properties. Moreover, our model predicts the absolute value of the neutrino masses; these are in the range m(nu)similar or equal to 0.005-0.052 eV.

TI A high molar extinction coefficient charge transfer sensitizer and its
   application in dye-sensitized solar cell
SO JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY A-CHEMISTRY
AB A high molar extinction coefficient charge transfer sensitizer tetrabutylammonium [Ru(4,-carboxylic acid-4'-carboxylate-2,2'-bipyridine)(4,4'di-(2-(3,6-dimethoxyphenyl)ethenyl)-2,2'-bipyridine)(NCS)(2)], is developed which upon anchoring onto nanocrystalline TiO2 films exhibit superior power conversion efficiency compared to the standard sensitizer bistetrabutylammonium cis-dithiocyanatobis(4,4'-dicarboxylic acid-2,2'bipyridine)ruthenium(II) (N719). The new sensitizer anchored TiO2 films harvest visible light very efficiently over a large spectral range and produce a short-circuit photocurrent density of 18.84 mA/cm(2), open-circuit voltage 783 mV and fill factor 0.73, resulting remarkable solar-to-electric energy conversion efficiency (eta) 10.82, under Air Mass (AM) 1.5 sunlight. The Time Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) excited state calculations of the new sensitizer show that the first three HOMOs have ruthenium t(2g) character with sizable contribution coming from the NCS ligands and the pi-bonding orbitals of the 4,4'-di-(2-(3,6-dimethoxyphenyl)ethenyl)-2,2'-bipyridine. The LUMO is a pi* orbital localized on the 4,4'-dicarboxylic acid-2,2'-bipyridine ligand. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Photocatalytic water splitting under visible light with particulate
   semiconductor catalysts
SO CATALYSIS SURVEYS FROM ASIA
AB Photocatalytic water splitting (PWS) is the most promising technology to produce H-2 energy directly from renewable water and solar light. PWS has made a remarkable progress last decades under ultra-violet (UV) light, but there are many technical challenges remaining for PWS under visible light. Several approaches are taken in search of photocatalysts efficient for PWS under visible light: (i) to find new single phase materials, (ii) to decorate UV-active photocatalysts with a photosensitizer absorbing visible light, (iii) to tune the band gap energy by modifying cations or anions of UV-active photocatalysts with substitutional doping, and (iv) to fabricate multi-component photocatalysts by forming composites or solid solutions. This article discusses the above approaches based on our experimental results as well as data available in the literature. At the moment, the greatest challenge to the progress of visible light PWS is the low efficiency of light utilization. Finding new photocatalytic materials with unique structure and phase is still the key to the success. In addition, the synthesis of these materials with high crystallinity and high surface area is also important, because these properties exert great impact on the activity of the material of the same structure and phase. Finally, smart combination and modification of known materials could also be fruitful.

TI Titan's internal structure inferred from a coupled thermal-orbital model
SO ICARUS
AB Through coupled thermal and orbital calculations including a full description of tidal dissipation. heat transfer and the H2O-NH3 phase diagram, we propose a model for the internal Structure and composition of Titan testable with Cassini-Huygens measurements. The high value of Titan's orbital eccentricity provides a strong constraint on the amount of the tidal energy dissipation on its surface and within its interior since its formation. We show that only models with a few percent of ammonia (and not zero) in the primordial liquid water shell can limit the damping of the eccentricity over the age of the Solar System. The present models predict that a liquid ammonia-rich water layer should still be present within Titan under an ice 1 layer, a few tens of kilometers thick. Furthermore, we predict that any event linked to convective processes in the ice Ih layer (like the degassing of methane) Could have occurred very late in Titan's history. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

TI The correlation between solar energetic particle peak intensities and
   speeds of coronal mass ejections: Effects of ambient particle
   intensities and energy spectra
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
AB The correlation of peak intensities of solar energetic particle (SEP) events with the speeds of the associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is understood to be a result of SEP acceleration at shocks driven by the CMEs. However, the peak SEP intensities associated with CMEs of a given speed vary over similar to 4 orders of magnitude. We examine a database of 71 E > 10 MeV SEP events observed with the GOES satellite to determine whether enhanced ambient SEP intensities at the times of the CMEs and/or variations among SEP event spectra contribute to the large range of peak SEP event intensities. A statistical analysis shows that enhanced ambient SEP intensities may be a contributing factor to the range of SEP events of higher peak intensities, probably by providing sources of energetic seed particles for the shock acceleration process. Another factor is the variation of energy spectra among the SEP events, which generally have harder spectra with increasing peak intensities. The observed increase of peak SEP intensities and hardening of peak SEP spectra with increasingly westward solar source regions is only a minor factor in the range. of SEP peak intensities in the CME speed correlation.

TI Observations of relativistic electron microbursts in association with
   VLF chorus
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
AB The Solar, Anomalous and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer (SAMPEX) satellite frequently observes relativistic (>1 MeV) electron precipitation in the radiation belts at L shells of 4-6 with bursty temporal structure lasting <1 s. This phenomenon can occur at all local times but is most often seen between 0200 and 1000 magnetic local time. VLF chorus is also observed to occur preferentially at these same local times. Using electron observations from the SAMPEX satellite Heavy Ion Large Telescope and data from the Polar satellite plasma wave instrument, we show correlation between observations of relativistic electron microbursts and VLF chorus with frequencies <2 kHz. In addition, the duration of the individual rising frequency chorus elements is comparable to the duration of the relativistic electron microbursts. It has been speculated that relativistic electron microbursts are caused by wave-particle interactions, which strongly scatter electrons into the loss cone for a short period. Lower-energy electron microbursts in the range from tens to hundreds of keV have long been associated with chorus waves, since these lower-energy electrons can resonate at the equator with whistler-mode waves at chorus frequencies. Electrons of MeV energies do not satisfy the first-order cyclotron resonance condition with chorus wave frequencies at the equator. However, MeV electrons may interact with chorus through higher-order resonances or off-equatorial interactions.

TI Three-flavor MSW solutions of the solar neutrino problem
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We perform an updated phenomenological analysis of the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) solutions of the solar neutrino problem, assuming oscillations between two and three neutrino families. The analysis includes the total rates of the Homestake. SAGE, GALLEX, Kamiokande and Super-Kamiokande experiments, as well as the day-night asymmetry and the 18-bin energy spectrum of Super-Kamiokande. Solutions are found at several values of the theta(13) mixing angle. Among the most interesting features, we find that solar neutrino data alone put the constraint theta(13)less than or similar to 55 degrees-59 degrees at 95% C.L., and that a fraction of the MSW solutions extends at and beyond maximal (nu(1), nu(2)) mixing (theta(12)greater than or equal to pi/4), especially if the neutrino square mass splitting is in its lower range (m(2)(2)- m(1)(2)similar to 10(-7) eV(2)) and if theta(13) is nonzero. In particular, bimaximal (or nearly bimaximal) mixing is possible for atmospheric and MSW solar neutrino oscillations within the stringent reactor bounds on theta(13).

TI Neutrino magnetic moments, flavor mixing, and the Super-Kamiokande solar
   data
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We find that magnetic neutrino-electron scattering is unaffected by oscillations for vacuum mixing of Dirac neutrinos with only diagonal moments and for Majorana neutrinos with two flavors. For Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein mixing, these cases are again obtained, though the effective moments can depend on the neutrino energy. Thus. e.g., the magnetic moments measured with <(nu)over bar>(e), from a reactor and nu(e) from the Sun could be different. With minimal assumptions, we find a new limit on mu(nu) using the 825-d Super-Kamiokande solar neutrino data: \mu(nu)\ less than or equal to 1.5 x 10(-10) mu(B) at 90% CL, comparable to the existing reactor limit.

TI Fermi acceleration at the fast shock in a solar flare and the impulsive
   loop-top hard X-ray source
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB Because of its high injection energy, Fermi acceleration has not been considered to be viable to explain nonthermal electrons (20-100 keV) produced in solar flares. Here we propose that nonthermal electrons are efficiently accelerated by the first-order Fermi process at the fast shock, as a natural consequence of the new magnetohydrodynamic picture of the flaring region revealed with Yohkoh. An oblique fast shock is naturally formed below the reconnection site and boosts the acceleration to significantly decrease the injection energy. The slow shocks attached to the reconnection X-point heat the plasma up to 10-20 MK, exceeding the injection energy. The combination of the oblique shock configuration and the preheating by the slow shock allows bulk electron acceleration from the thermal pool. The accelerated electrons are trapped between the two slow shocks due to the magnetic mirror downstream of the fast shock, thus explaining the impulsive loop-top hard X-ray source discovered with Yohkoh. The acceleration timescale is similar to 0.3-0.6 s, which is consistent with the timescaIe of impulsive bursts. When these electrons stream away from the region enclosed by the fast shock and the slow shocks, they are released toward the footpoints and may form the simultaneous double-source hard X-ray structure at the footpoints of the reconnected field lines.

TI Efficiency of sunlight utilization: Tubular versus flat photobioreactors
SO BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOENGINEERING
AB The light saturation effect imposes a serious limitation on the efficiency with which solar energy can be utilized in outdoor algal cultures. One solution proposed to reduce the intensity of incident solar radiation and overcome the light saturation effect is ''spatial dilution of light'' (i.e., distribution of the impinging photon flux on a greater photosynthetic surface area), but consistent experimental data supporting a significant positive influence of spatial light dilution on the productivity and the photosynthetic efficiency of outdoor algal cultures have never been reported. We used a coiled tubular reactor and compared a near-horizontal straight tubular reactor and a near-horizontal flat panel in outdoor cultivation of the cyanobacterium Arthrospira (Spirulina) platensis under defined operating conditions for optimum productivity. The photosynthetic efficiency achieved in the tubular systems was significantly higher because their curved surface ''diluted'' the impinging solar radiation and thus reduced the light saturation effect. This interpretation was supported by the results of experiments carried out in the laboratory under continuous artificial illumination using both a flat and a curved chamber reactor. The study also showed that, when the effect of light saturation is eliminated or reduced, productivity and solar irradiance are linearly correlated even at very high diurnal irradiance values, and supported findings that outdoor algal cultures are light-limited even during bright summer days. It was also observed that, besides improving the photosynthetic efficiency of the culture, spatial dilution of light also leads to higher growth rates and lowers the cellular content of accessory pigments; that is, it reduces mutual shading in the culture. The inadequacy of using volumetric productivity as the sole criterion for comparing reactors of different surface-to-volume ratio and of the areal productivity for evaluating the performance of elevated photobioreactors operated outdoors is stressed; it is furthermore suggested that the photosynthetic efficiency achieved by the cu Itu re also be calculated to provide a suitable parameter for comparison of different algal cultivation systems operated under similar climatic conditions.

Excited-state lifetimes of the entrapped complexes have been measured and their temperature dependence established. While entrapment of the complexes in the zeolite matrix introduces no major modifications in structure or electron distribution, it does induce changes in the efficiency of various excited state energy dissipation pathways, the major effect being an increase in the energy of the metal-centered dd excited states which leads to elimination of one of the major decay and decomposition pathways.

TI ENERGY-BALANCE IN THE SOLAR TRANSITION REGION .2. EFFECTS OF PRESSURE
   AND ENERGY INPUT ON HYDROSTATIC MODELS
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB In this paper we address the question of how energy is radiated by hydrogen lines and continua hydrostatic energy-balance models of the transition region between the solar chromosphere and corona. Our models assume that mechanical or magnetic energy is dissipated in the hot corona and is then transported toward the chromosphere down the steep temperature gradient of the transition region. This model can be applied to the lower portions of magnetic flux tubes in which the temperature varies from chromospheric to coronal values. and to either open field or loop models. The basic difference between our calculations and those of other authors is that our theoretical hydrostatic energy-balance models properly take into account the diffusion of hydrogen atoms and ions. Diffusion, which was introduced in a previous paper, arises naturally due to the concentration and temperature gradients and is characterized by the ambipolar diffusion velocity. The diffusion effects are used in both the statistical equilibrium and energy balance equations and, as shown earlier. give order of magnitude agreement between calculations and the observations of the hydrogen Lyman continuum and Lyman lines in the average quiet Sun. The present paper describes various models constructed for the transition regions that correspond to different features of the solar atmosphere. Our calculations give the magnitude and distribution of energy radiated by the lower transition region after being transported down from the corona. Wc find that our models not only explain the average quiet Sun but also the entire range of variability of the Ly-alpha lines. We describe the relations between the downward energy flux, the pressure of the transition region, and the different hydrogen emissions. We show how the usual optically thin radiative loss curve can be modified to give agreement with our detailed calculations. and the extent to which this method can be used for estimating the actual radiative losses. Also, we show how the usual emission measure method can be modified to treat the Ly-alpha line emission, and we discuss the limitations of the emission measure approach.

TI Efficiency enhancement in organic solar cells with ferroelectric
   polymers
SO NATURE MATERIALS
AB The recombination of electrons and holes in semiconducting polymer-fullerene blends has been identified as a main cause of energy loss in organic photovoltaic devices. Generally, an external bias voltage is required to efficiently separate the electrons and holes and thus prevent their recombination. Here we show that a large, permanent, internal electric field can be ensured by incorporating a ferroelectric polymer layer into the device, which eliminates the need for an external bias. The electric field, of the order of 50 V mu m(-1), potentially induced by the ferroelectric layer is tens of times larger than that achievable by the use of electrodes with different work functions. We show that ferroelectric polymer layers enhanced the efficiency of several types of organic photovoltaic device from 1-2% without layers to 4-5% with layers. These enhanced efficiencies are 10-20% higher than those achieved by other methods, such as morphology and electrode work-function optimization. The devices show the unique characteristics of ferroelectric photovoltaic devices with switchable diode polarity and tunable efficiency.

TI Efficient water oxidation at carbon nanotube-polyoxometalate
   electrocatalytic interfaces
SO NATURE CHEMISTRY
AB Water is the renewable, bulk chemical that nature uses to enable carbohydrate production from carbon dioxide. The dream goal of energy research is to transpose this incredibly efficient process and make an artificial device whereby the catalytic splitting of water is finalized to give a continuous production of oxygen and hydrogen. Success in this task would guarantee the generation of hydrogen as a carbon-free fuel to satisfy our energy demands at no environmental cost. Here we show that very efficient and stable nanostructured, oxygen-evolving anodes are obtained by the assembly of an oxygen-evolving polyoxometalate cluster (a totally inorganic ruthenium catalyst) with a conducting bed of multiwalled carbon nanotubes. Our bioinspired electrode addresses the one major challenge of artificial photosynthesis, namely efficient water oxidation, which brings us closer to being able to power the planet with carbon-free fuels.

TI Visible light absorption ability and photocatalytic oxidation activity
   of various interstitial N-doped TiO2 prepared from different nitrogen
   dopants
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Nitrogen-doped TiO2 was developed to enable photocatalytic reactions using the visible range of the solar spectrum. This work reports on the synthesis, characterisation and kinetic study of interstitial N-doped TiO2 prepared by the sol-gel method using three different types of nitrogen dopants: diethanolamine, triethylamine and urea. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and UV-visible spectroscopy were used to analyse the titania. Different interstitial N-doped TiO2 properties, such as absorption ability in the UV-visible light region, redshift in adsorption edge, good crystallisation and composition ratio of titania structures (anatase and rutile) could be obtained from different nitrogen dopants. Amongst investigated nitrogen precursors, diethanolamine provided the highest visible light absorption ability of interstitial N-doped TiO2 with the smallest energy bandgap and the smallest anatase crystal size, resulting in the highest efficiency in 2-chlorophenol degradation. The photocatalytic activity of all N-doped TiO2 can be arranged in the following order: TiO2/diethanolamine > TiO2/triethylamine > TiO2/urea > un-doped TiO2. The initial rate of 2-chlorophenol degradation using the interstitial N-doped TiO2 with diethanolamine was 0.59 mg/L-min and the kinetic constant was 2.34 x 10(-2) min(-1) with a half-life of 98 min. In all cases, hydroquinone was detected as a major intermediate in the degradation of 2-chlorophenol. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Substrate-dependent interface composition and charge transport in films

SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The buried interface composition of polymer-fullerene blends is found by near-edge x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy to depend on the surface energy of the substrate upon which they are cast. The interface composition determines the type of charge transport measured with thin film transistors. These results have implications for organic photovoltaics device design and the use of transistors to evaluate bulk mobility in blends.

TI Efficient structural modification of triphenylamine-based organic dyes
   for dye-sensitized solar cells
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB A series of new organic D-g-A dyes, coded as DS-1, DS-2, DS-3, and DS-4, was designed, synthesized, and characterized by H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, infrared spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis. These dyes consist of a di(p-tolyl)phenylamine moiety as an electron donor, a cyanoacetic acid moiety as an electron acceptor/anchoring group, and different types of conducting thiophene units as electron spacers to bridge the donor and acceptor. It was found that both the use of di(p-tolyl)phenylamine donor and the variation of electron spacers in the D-pi-A dyes played an essential role in modifying and/or tuning physical properties of organic dyes. These dyes were developed as sensitizers for the application in dye-sensitized TiO2 nanocrystalline solar cells (DSSCs), and their photophysical and electrochemical properties were investigated. The DSSCs based on the dyes gave good performance in terms of incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) in the range of 400-700 nm. A solar-energy-to-electricity conversion efficiency (eta) of 7.00% was obtained with the DSSC based on 5-[[2-[p-(di-p-tolylamino)]styryl]thiophene-yl]thiophene-2-cyanoacrylic acid (DS-2) under simulated AM 1.5 G irradiation (100 mW/cm(2)): short-circuit current density (J(sc)) of 15.3 mA cm(-2); open-circuit voltage (V-oc) of 0.633 V; fill factor (FF) of 0.725. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation suggests that the electron-transfer distribution moves from the donor unit to the acceptor under light irradiation, which means efficient intramolecular charge transfer.

TI Material considerations for terawatt level deployment of photovoltaics
SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
CT Symposium on Materials, Devices, and Prospects for Sustainable Energy of
   the European-Materials-Research-Society Meeting
CY MAY 29-JUN 02, 2006
CL Nice, FRANCE
SP European Mat Res Soc
AB The stabilization of future CO, atmospheric concentrations to levels that might prevent anthropogenic alterations of the world climate calls for tens of terawatts of carbon free renewable energy resources. The combined energy production potential of all known non-solar carbon-free renewable resources seems insufficient to meet these targets. Consequently, over the next decades solar energy, and in particular photovoltaics, is expected to fill the gap.
   In this work several mature photovoltaic technologies, ranging from silicon to thin films, and solar concentrator systems are analyzed. The estimates of the energy production limits are established for each technology, based on available global material reserves. It is shown that many existing technologies, albeit playing an important in the present sub-gigawatt energy production levels, are affected by severe material shortages, that would prevent their scale-up to the terawatt range. This is the case for thin film solar cells technologies based on CdTe and CIGS where the showstopper is the scarcity of tellurium and indium respectively. Despite the abundance of silicon, crystalline Si-based solar cells will hardly reach the terawatt range as additional scale-up of the technology will be impeded by the global reserves of silver, commonly used as electrode material. As for amorphous silicon and dye sensitized thin film technologies, avoiding the use of indium tin oxide transparent conductor films appears as a must for exceeding the few tenth of terawatt barrier. For existing III-V concentrator cells, operating under moderate concentration (<200X), terawatt year level may be afforded by circumventing the use of Ge substrates and by minimizing the use of In and An in the cell fabrication process.
   In conclusion the study summarizes current material challenges for terawatt level deployment of the existing solar cells, and for each technology, identifies improvements and innovations needed for further scale-up. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A thermoplastic gel electrolyte for stable quasi-solid-state
   dye-sensitized solar cells
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are receiving considerable attention as low-cost alternatives to conventional solar cells. In DSSCs based on liquid electrolytes, a photoelectric efficiency of 11% has been achieved, but potential problems in sealing the cells and the low long-term stability of these systems have impeded their practical use. Here, we present a thermoplastic gel electrolyte (TPGE) as an alternative to the liquid electrolytes used in DSSCs. The TPGE exhibits a thermoplastic character, high conductivity, long-term stability, and can be prepared by a simple and convenient protocol. The viscosity, conductivity, and phase state of the TPGE can be controlled by tuning the composition. Using 40 wt % poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as the polymeric host, 60 wt % propylene carbonate (PC) as the solvent, and 0.65 M KI and 0.065 M I-2 as the ionic conductors, a TPGE with a conductivity of 2.61 mS cm(-2) is prepared. Based on this TPGE, a DSSC is fabricated with an overall light-to-electrical-energy conversion efficiency of 7.22 % under 100 mW cm(-2) irradiation. The present findings should accelerate the widespread use of DSSCs.

TI Organic solar cells. Supramolecular composites of porphyrins and
   fullerenes organized by polypeptide structures as light harvesters
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY
AB We have constructed supramolecular solar cells composed of a series of porphyrin-peptide oligomers [porphyrin functionalized alpha-polypeptides, P(H2P)(n) or P(ZnP)(n) (n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16)], and fullerenes assembled on a nanostructured SnO2 electrode using an electrophoretic deposition method. Remarkable enhancement in the photoelectrochemical performance as well as the broader photoresponse in the visible and near-infrared regions is seen with increasing the number of porphyrin units in alpha-polypeptide structures. Formation of supramolecular clusters of porphyrins and fullerenes prepared in acetonitrile-toluene = 3 : 1 has been confirmed by transmission electron micrographs (TEM) and the absorption spectra. The highly colored composite clusters of porphyrin-peptide oligomers and fullerenes have been assembled as three-dimensional arrays onto nanostructured SnO2 films using an electrophoretic deposition method. A high power conversion efficiency (g) of similar to 1.6% and the maximum incident photon-tophotocurrent efficiency (IPCE = 56%) were attained using composite clusters of free base and zinc porphyrin-peptide hexadecamers [P(H2P)(16) and P(ZnP)(16)] with fullerenes, respectively. Femtosecond transient absorption and fluorescence measurements of porphyrin-fullerene composite films confirm improved electron-transfer properties with increasing number of porphyrins in a polypeptide unit. The formation of molecular assemblies between porphyrins and fullerenes with a polypeptide structure controls the electron-transfer efficiency in the supramolecular complexes, meeting the criteria required for efficient light energy conversion.

TI Screening of water-splitting thermochemical cycles potentially
   attractive for hydrogen production by concentrated solar energy
SO ENERGY
AB Hydrogen, a promising and clean energy carrier, could potentially replace the use of fossil fuels in the transportation sector. Currently, no environmentally attractive, large-scale, low-cost and high-efficiency hydrogen production process is available for commercialization. Solar-driven water-splitting thermochemical cycles may constitute one of the ultimate options for CO2-free production of hydrogen. The method is environmentally friendly since it uses only water and solar energy. First, the potentially attractive thermochemical cycles must be identified based on a set of criteria. To reach this goal, a database that contains 280 referenced cycles was established. Then, the selection and evaluation of the promising cycles was performed in the temperature range of 900-2000 degrees C, suitable to the use of concentrated solar energy. About 30 cycles selected for further investigations are presented in this paper. The principles and basis for a thermodynamic evaluation of the cycles are also given. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Acceleration mechanism responsible for the formation of the new
   radiation belt during the 2003 Halloween solar storm
SO GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB [1] Observations of the relativistic electron flux increases during the first days of November, 2003 are compared to model simulations of two leading mechanisms for electron acceleration. It is demonstrated that radial diffusion driven by ULF waves cannot explain the formation of the new radiation belt in the slot region and instead predicts a decay of fluxes during the recovery phase of the October 31st storm. Compression of the plasmasphere during the main phases of the storm created preferential conditions for local acceleration during interactions with VLF chorus. Local acceleration of electrons at L = 3 is modelled with a 2-D pitch-angle, energy diffusion code. We show that the energy diffusion driven by whistler mode waves can explain the gradual build up of fluxes to energies exceeding 3 MeV in a new radiation belt which is formed in the slot region normally devoid of high energy electrons.

TI Comparative planetary atmospheres: Models of TrES-1 and HD 209458B
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB We present new self-consistent atmosphere models for the transiting planets TrES-1 and HD 209458b. The planets were recently observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope in bands centered on 4.5 and 8.0 mu m, for TrES-1, and 24 mu m, for HD 209458b. We find that standard solar-metallicity models fit the observations for HD 209458b. For TrES-1, which has a T-eff similar to 300 K cooler, we find that models with a metallicity 3-5 times enhanced over solar abundances can match the 1 sigma error bar at 4.5 mu m and 2 sigma at 8.0 mu m. Models with solar abundances that include energy deposition into the stratosphere give fluxes that fall within the 2 sigma error bars in both bands. The best-fit models for both planets assume that reradiation of absorbed stellar flux occurs over the entire planet. For all models of both planets, we predict planet-to-star flux ratios in other Spitzer bandpasses.

TI Energy and exergy analysis of a ground source (geothermal) heat pump
   system
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB Ground source heat pumps (GSHPs), often referred to as geothermal heat pumps (GHPs), offer an attractive option for heating and cooling residential and commercial buildings owing to their higher energy efficiency compared with conventional systems. GSHPs have been used for four years in the Turkish market, although they have been in use for more years in developed countries. The purpose of this study is to present an energy and exergy analysis of a GSHP system with a 50 m vertical 1.25 in. nominal diameter U-bend ground heat exchanger. This system was applied to a 65 m(2) room in the Solar Energy Institute, Ege University, Izmir, for the first time at the university level in Turkey. The Institute, built in 1986, has a livable floor area of 3000 m(2) and uses passive solar techniques. The heating and cooling loads of the room studied were 3.8 and 4.2 kW at design conditions, respectively. The system was commissioned in May 2000, and performance tests have been conducted since then. The exergy transports between the components and the consumptions in each of the components of the GSHP system were determined for the average measured parameters obtained from the experimental results in February 2001. The exergy diagram (the Grassmann diagram) was also presented for the GSHP system studied to give quantitative information regarding the proportion of the exergy input that is dissipated in the various system components.

TI Three-dimensional magnetic field topology in a region of solar coronal
   heating
SO NATURE
AB Flares and X-ray jets on the Sun arise in active regions where magnetic flux emerges from the solar interior amd interacts with the ambient magnetic field(1,2). The interactions are believed to occur in electric current sheets separating regions of opposite magnetic polarity. The current sheets located in the corona or upper chromosphere have long been thought to act as an important source of coronal heating(3-6), requiring their location in the corona or upper chromosphere. The dynamics and energetics of these sheets are governed by a complex magnetic field structure that, until now, has been difficult to measure. Here we report the determination of the full magnetic vector in an interaction region near the base of the solar corona. The observations reveal two magnetic features that characterize young active regions on the Sun: a set of rising magnetic loops and a tangential discontinuity of the magnetic field direction, the latter being the observational signature of an electric current sheet. This provides strong support for coronal heating models based on the dissipation of magnetic energy at current sheets.

TI An n=90 internal potential function of the Martian crustal magnetic
   field
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS
AB [1] A potential function using spherical harmonics up to degree and order 90 was derived from a selection of Mars Global Surveyor vector data. These included all three components of those taken below 200 km altitude during the two aerobraking phases (AB1 and AB2), the Science Phase Orbits (SPO), and the higher-altitude (367-435 km) data taken on the nightside during the Mapping Phase Orbits (MPO). The merger of these sets of data provided total global coverage. The technique used was a least squares minimization developed for Earth field analysis whereby the relative weighting of each data source was determined by the width of a Gaussian fit to the residual distribution about the potential function. Also, data selection by area and area weight functions were used to improve normalization. The residual misfit distributions for the vertical component for different data sources are (nT) AB1, 6.5; AB2 (in shadow), 6.7; AB2 (sunlit), 10.3; SPO, 6.4; and MPO, 5.9. The horizontal component misfits are about the same for MPO and AB2 in shadow, but for data taken in sunlight the scatter of horizontal component residuals increases by 50% for AB1, a factor of two for SPO, and 30% for AB2. The energy density spectrum evaluated at 3535 km radius (the mean altitude of the AB and SPO data) decreased from a high of 0.2 J/km(3) near n = 20 to an order of magnitude less at n = 90. Most of the power in the spectrum lies between n = 15 and n = 40. The dipole moment was only 8 x 10(16) A . m(2), which is likely close to the noise of the coefficients. This spectrum is 40 times greater than that of Earth at the scale sizes represented by values of n from 20 to 40. Comparisons with other published maps and models for Mars show general agreement with the field representations at MPO altitudes, but disagreements up to several hundred nT in components calculated for areodetic altitudes below 200 km.

TI Global analysis of solar neutrino oscillations including SNOCC
   measurement
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB For active and sterile neutrinos, we present the globally allowed solutions for two neutrino oscillations. We include the SNO CC measurement and all other relevant solar neutrino and reactor data. Five active neutrino oscillation solutions (LMA, LOW, SMA, VAC, and Just So(2)) are currently allowed at 3sigma; three sterile neutrino solutions (Just So(2), SMA, and VAC) are allowed at 3sigma. The goodness of fit is satisfactory for all eight solutions. We also investigate the robustness of the allowed solutions by carrying out global analyses with and without: 1) imposing solar model constraints on the (8)B neutrino flux, 2) including the Super-Kamiokande spectral energy distribution and day-night data, 3) including a continuous mixture of active and sterile neutrinos, 4) using an enhanced CC cross section for deuterium (due to radiative corrections), and 5) an optimistic, hypothetical reduction by a factor of three of the error of the SNO CC rate. For every analysis strategy used in this paper, the most favored solutions all involve large mixing angles: LMA, LOW, or VAC. The favored solutions are robust, but the existence at 3sigma of individual sterile solutions and the active Just So(2) solution is sensitive to the analysis assumptions.

We perform our analysis of the contained events data as well as the upward-going neutrino-induced muon fluxes. in addition to the previous data samples of Frejus, Nusex, IMB and Kamioka experiments, we include the full data set of the 52 kton-yr of Super-Kamiokande, the recent 4.6 kton-yr contained events of Soudan2 and the results on upgoing muons from the MACRO and Baksan detectors. From the statistical analysis it emerges that the nu(mu) --> nu(tau) channel provides the best agreement with the combined data, with a best fit point of sin(2)(2 theta) = 0.99 and Delta m(2) = 3.0 x 10(-3) eV(2). Although somehow disfavoured, the nu(mu) --> nu(s) channels cannot be ruled out on the basis of the: global fit to the full set of observables. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Aerosol modulation of atmospheric and surface solar heating over the
   tropical Indian Ocean
SO TELLUS SERIES B-CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL METEOROLOGY
AB The major finding of this study is that aerosols over the tropical Indian Ocean enhance clear sky atmospheric solar heating significantly and decrease the surface solar heating by even a larger amount. The results presented here are based on aerosol chemical, microphysical, and optical and radiometric data collected at the island of Kaashidhoo (4.97 degrees N, 73.47 degrees E) during February and March of 1998, as part of the first held phase of the Indian Ocean experiment (INDOEX). The aelosol optical properties were integrated with a multiple scattering Monte Carlo radiative transfer model which was validated at the surface with broadband flux measurements and at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) with the clouds and earth's radiant energy system (CERES) radiation budget measurements. We consider both externally and internally mixed aerosol models with very little difference between the two models in the estimated forcing. For the February-March period, the aerosols increase the monthly mean clear sky atmospheric solar heating by about 12 W/m(2) (about 15% of the total atmospheric solar heating) and decrease the sea surface clear sky solar heating by about 16 W/m(2) with a daily range from 5 to 23 W/m(2). The net aerosol forcing at the top of the atmosphere is about -4 W/m(2) with a daily range from -2 to -6 W/m(2). Although the soot contributes only about 10% to the aerosol optical thickness, it contributes more than 50% to the aerosol induced atmospheric solar heating. The fundamental conclusion of this study is that anthropogenic aerosols over the tropical Indian Ocean are altering the clear sky radiation budget of thr atmosphere and surface in a major manner.

SO PROGRESS IN PHOTOVOLTAICS
AB This paper details the laboratory processes used to fabricate CdS/CdTe solar cells at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The basic fabrication technique includes low-pressure chemical vapor deposited SnO2, chemical-bath deposited CdS, close-spaced sublimated CdTe, solution-CdCl2 treatment, and an acid-contact etch, followed by application of a doped-graphite paste. This paper also describes the results of a reproducibility study in which cells were produced by multiple operators with an aver age AM1-5 efficiency of 12.6%. And finally, this paper discusses process sensitivities and alternative cell fabrication procedures and reports fabrication of a cell with an AM1-5 efficiency of 15.4%.

AB Heat powered solid sorption is a feasible alternative to electrical vapour compression. However, the emergence of that technology takes time. In this review, the possibilities and limits of this technology are analysed. The performances are shown to be very interesting and in progress, and right now applications are foreseen, The use of waste heat for solid sorption air-conditioning may be an attractive application, but, for a large dissemination, higher efficiencies as well as cost reduction are required. With respect to primary energy and global warming, sorption cooling and heat pumping is coherent, except for waste heat or solar applications, only if the cooling COP is larger than about 1 or 1.2 depending on operating conditions. Technical results are close to that point which provide a wider perspective. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The role of helium in the outer solar atmosphere
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB We construct models of the outer solar atmosphere comprising the region from the mid-chromosphere and into the solar wind in order to study the force and energy balance in models with a significant helium abundance. The corona is created by dissipation of an energy flux from the Sun. The energy flux is lost as radiation from the top of the chromosphere and as gravitational and kinetic solar wind energy flux. We find that in models with significant ion heating of the extended corona most of the energy flux is lost in the solar wind. The ion temperatures are higher than the electron temperature in these models, and the alpha-particle temperature is much higher than the proton temperature, so there is energy transfer from the alpha-particle fluid to the protons and electrons, but this energy exchange between the different species is relatively small. To a fairly good approximation we can say that the energy flux deposited in the protons and alpha-particles is lost as kinetic and gravitational energy flux in the proton and alpha-particle flow. How this energy flux is divided between gravitational and kinetic energy flux (i.e., how large the particle fluxes and flow speeds are) depends upon details of the heating process. We also find that mixing processes in the chromosphere play an important role in determining the coronal helium abundance and the relative solar wind proton and alpha-particle fluxes. Roughly speaking, we find that the relative alpha-particle and proton fluxes are set by the degree of chromospheric mixing, while the speeds are set by the details of the coronal heating process.

TI Whisper, a resonance sounder and wave analyser: Performances and
   perspectives for the Cluster mission
SO SPACE SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB The WHISPER sounder on the Cluster spacecraft is primarily designed to provide an absolute measurement of the total plasma density within the range 0.2-80 cm(-3). This is achieved by means of a resonance sounding technique which has already proved successful in the regions to be explored. The wave analysis function of the instrument is provided by FFT calculation. Compared with the swept frequency wave analysis of previous sounders, this technique has several new capabilities. In particular, when used for natural wave measurements (which cover here the 2-80 kHz range), it offers a flexible trade-off between time and frequency resolutions. In the basic nominal operational mode, the density is measured every 28 s, the frequency and time resolution for the wave measurements are about 600 Hz and 2.2 s, respectively. Better resolutions can be obtained, especially when the spacecraft telemetry is in burst mode. Special attention has been paid to the coordination of WHISPER operations with the wave instruments, as well as with the low-energy particle counters. When operated from the multi-spacecraft Cluster, the WHISPER instrument is expected to contribute in particular to the study of plasma waves in the electron foreshock and solar wind, to investigations about small-scale structures via density and high-frequency emission signatures, and to the analysis of the non-thermal continuum in the magnetosphere.

TI Radiative symmetry breaking in a supersymmetric model with an extra U(1)
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS A
AB Radiative symmetry breaking is studied in a superstring-inspired supersymmetric model which is extended with a low energy extra U(1) symmetry. In this model the mu problem is radiatively solved in an automatic way. The right-handed neutrino can be heavy and the seesaw mechanism will produce the small neutrino mass which makes the MSW solution applicable to the solar neutrino problem. We search a parameter region which has the favorable feature for the radiative symmetry breaking at the weak scale. A rather wide parameter region is found to be allowed. Although there are certain dependences on the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters in the estimation of masses of various fields, the upper bound of the extra Z boson mass is estimated to be m(Z2) less than or equal to 2000 GeV for a top mass range 150 GeV less than or equal to mt less than or equal to 190 GeV within a suitable parameter region (m(0) < 1 TeV ana m(1/2) < 200 GeV). Some phenomenological features of the extra Z boson are also and presented.

TI On the electrical and optical properties of CdS films thermally
   deposited by a modified source
SO THIN SOLID FILMS
AB CdS films were prepared by a physical vacuum deposition technique on an amorphous (glass) substrate using a modified evaporation source. The effect of the processing conditions ( the film thickness, substrate temperature and the deposition rate) were considered in comparison with the normal evaporation source. A van der Pauw four-probe arrangement was used for measuring the electrical resistivity, which varies between 0.1 x 10(4) and 8.18 x 10(4) Omega cm. It decreases with increasing film thickness, and decreasing deposition rate and substrate temperature. This was attributed to the effect of crystallite size, the degree of preferred orientation, internal microstrain and the stoichiometry. From spectrophotometric measuring and using an approximate formula, the optical parameters (n, k, alpha) were evaluated. The values of the refractive indices and the energy gaps were evaluated and correlated with the preparation parameters.

TI CHARACTERIZATION OF ALKANES AND PARAFFIN WAXES FOR APPLICATION AS
   PHASE-CHANGE ENERGY-STORAGE MEDIUM
SO ENERGY SOURCES
AB Latent thermal energy storage is one of the favorable kinds of thermal energy storage methods considered for renewable energy source utilization, as in solar photothermal systems. Heat is stored mostly by means of the latent heat of phase change of the medium. The temperature of the medium remains more or less constant during the phase transition. A large number of materials have been identified for low, intermediate, and high operating temperatures for application as latent thermal energy storage media. In the present paper a method for characterization of alkanes (C1-C100) and paraffin waxes for application as the low-temperature (298-323 K) phase change energy storage medium is introduced. A computational technique is introduced by which the alkanes and paraffin waxes could be evaluated, and possibly upgraded, as the phase change energy storage media. It is demonstrated that the family of n-alkanes has a large spectrum of latent heats, melting points, densities, and specific heats so that the heat storage designer has a good choice of n-alkanes as storage materials for any particular low-temperature thermal energy storage application. As an example of the proposed method, a particular paraffin wax for which appropriate experimental data are available is analyzed and the results of the analysis are presented.

TI STAR DISK INTERACTIONS NEAR A MASSIVE BLACK-HOLE
SO MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
AB We examine the possibility that stars in the nuclei of galaxies could be 'ground down' into short-period orbits, by interaction with a disc around a central massive black hole.  A star on a highly eccentric orbit, which passed close to the hole, would lose energy and momentum in passing through the disc.  The cumulative effect of many passages would bring the star into a circular orbit corotating with the disc.  The star would then either open up a gap in the disc (if the disc is thinner than the star's Roche radius and the viscosity in the disc is sufficiently low), or accrete material from the disc.  By these processes, stars could, without prior disruption, acquire orbits whose binding energy to the hole greatly exceeds their self-binding energy, and may even be relativistic.  There are possible implications for the fuelling and variability of AGN.  In particular, a star on a tight bound orbit could modulate the luminosity in a periodic fashion.

TI A Possible Relativistic Jetted Outburst from a Massive Black Hole Fed by
   a Tidally Disrupted Star
SO SCIENCE
AB Gas accretion onto some massive black holes (MBHs) at the centers of galaxies actively powers luminous emission, but most MBHs are considered dormant. Occasionally, a star passing too near an MBH is torn apart by gravitational forces, leading to a bright tidal disruption flare (TDF). Although the high-energy transient Sw 1644+57 initially displayed none of the theoretically anticipated (nor previously observed) TDF characteristics, we show that observations suggest a sudden accretion event onto a central MBH of mass about 10(6) to 10(7) solar masses. There is evidence for a mildly relativistic outflow, jet collimation, and a spectrum characterized by synchrotron and inverse Compton processes; this leads to a natural analogy of Sw 1644+57 to a temporary smaller-scale blazar.

TI Three Dimensional Anisotropic k Spectra of Turbulence at Subproton
   Scales in the Solar Wind
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We show the first three dimensional (3D) dispersion relations and k spectra of magnetic turbulence in the solar wind at subproton scales. We used the Cluster data with short separations and applied the k-filtering technique to the frequency range where the transition to subproton scales occurs. We show that the cascade is carried by highly oblique kinetic Alfven waves with omega(plas) <= 0.1 omega(ci) down to k(perpendicular to)rho(i) similar to 2. Each k spectrum in the direction perpendicular to B(0) shows two scaling ranges separated by a breakpoint (in the interval [0.4, 1]k(perpendicular to)rho(i)): a Kolmogorov scaling k(perpendicular to)(-1.7) followed by a steeper scaling similar to k(perpendicular to)(-4.5). We conjecture that the turbulence undergoes a transition range, where part of the energy is dissipated into proton heating via Landau damping and the remaining energy cascades down to electron scales where electron Landau damping may predominate.

TI Intrinsic point defects and complexes in the quaternary kesterite
   semiconductor Cu2ZnSnS4
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Current knowledge of the intrinsic defect properties of Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) is limited, which is hindering further improvement of the performance of CZTS-based solar cells. Here, we have performed first-principles calculations for a series of intrinsic defects and defect complexes in CZTS, from which we have the following observations. (i) It is important to control the elemental chemical potentials during crystal growth to avoid the formation of secondary phases such as ZnS, CuS, and Cu2SnS3. (ii) The intrinsic p-type conductivity is attributed to the Cu-Zn antisite which has a lower formation energy and relatively deeper acceptor level compared to the Cu vacancy. (iii) The low formation energy of many of the acceptor defects will lead to the intrinsic p-type character, i.e., n-type doping is very difficult in this system. (iv) The role of electrically neutral defect complexes is predicted to be important, because they have remarkably low formation energies and electronically passivate deep levels in the band gap. For example, [Cu-Zn(-) + Zn-Cu(+)], [V-Cu(-) + Zn-Cu(+)], and [Zn-Sn(2-) + 2Zn(Cu)(+)] may form easily in nonstoichiometric samples. The band alignment between Cu2ZnSnS4, CuInSe2 and the solar-cell window layer CdS has also been calculated, revealing that a type-II band alignment exists for the CdS/Cu2ZnSnS4 heterojunction. The fundamental differences between CZTS and CuInSe2 for use in thin-film photovoltaics are discussed. The results are expected to be relevant to other I-2-II-IV-VI4 semiconductors.

TI Synthesis and characterization of porphyrin sensitizers with various
   electron-donating substituents for highly efficient dye-sensitized solar
   cells
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY
AB A series of porphyrin dyes with an electron-donating group (EDG) attached at a meso-position (YD1-YD8) have been designed and synthesized for use as sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC). The nature of the EDG exerts a significant influence on the spectral, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of these sensitizers. Absorption spectra of porphyrins having an amino group show broadened Soret band and red-shifted Q bands with respect to those of reference porphyrin YD0. This phenomenon is more pronounced for porphyrins YD7 and YD8 that have a pi-conjugated triphenylamine at the meso-position opposite the anchoring group. Upon introduction of an EDG at the meso-position, the potential for the first oxidation alters significantly to the negative whereas that for the first reduction changes inappreciably, indicating a decreased HOMO-LUMO gap. Results of density-functional theory (DFT) calculations support the spectroelectrochemical data for a delocalization of charge between the porphyrin ring and the amino group in the first oxidative state of diarylamino-substituted porphyrins YD1-YD4, which exhibit superior photovoltaic performance among all porphyrins under investigation. With long-chain alkyl groups on the diarylamino substituent, YD2 shows the best cell performance with J(SC) = 13.4 mA cm(-2), V(OC) = 0.71 V, and FF = 0.69, giving an overall efficiency 6.6% of power conversion under simulated one-sun AM1.5 illumination.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS
AB This paper examines the effect of environmental policies on technological innovation in the specific case of renewable energy. The analysis is conducted using patent data on a panel of 25 countries over the period 1978-2003. We find that public policy plays a significant role in determining patent applications. Different types of policy instruments are effective for different renewable energy sources. Broad-based policies, such as tradable energy certificates, are more likely to induce innovation on technologies that are close to competitive with fossil fuels. More targeted subsidies, such as feed-in tariffs, are needed to induce innovation on more costly energy technologies, such as solar power.

AB We present new subarcsecond (similar to 0.'' 7) Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) observations of the 1.3 mm continuum emission from circumstellar disks around 11 low- and intermediate-mass pre-main-sequence stars. High-resolution observations for three additional sources were obtained from the literature. In all cases the disk emission is spatially resolved. We adopt a self-consistent accretion disk model based on the similarity solution for the disk surface density and constrain the dust radial density distribution on spatial scales of about 40 AU. Disk surface densities appear to be correlated with the stellar ages where the characteristic disk radius increases from similar to 20 AU to similar to 100 AU over about 5 Myr. This disk expansion is accompanied by a decrease in the mass accretion rate, suggesting that our sample disks form an evolutionary sequence. Interpreting our results in terms of the temporal evolution of a viscous alpha-disk, we estimate (1) that at the beginning of the disk evolution about 60% of the circumstellar material was located inside radii of 25-40 AU, (2) that disks formed with masses from 0.05 to 0.4 M(circle dot), and (3) that the viscous timescale at the disk initial radius is about 0.1-0.3 Myr. Viscous disk models tightly link the surface density Sigma(R) with the radial profile of the disk viscosity nu(R) alpha R(gamma). We find values of gamma ranging from -0.8 to 0.8, suggesting that the viscosity dependence on the orbital radius can be very different in the observed disks. Adopting the alpha parameterization for the viscosity, we argue that alpha must decrease with the orbital radius and that it may vary between 0.5 and 10(-4). From the inferred disk initial radii we derive specific angular momenta, j, for parent cores of (0.8 -4) x 10(-4) km s(-1) pc. Comparison with the values of j in dense cores suggests that about 10% of core angular momentum and 30% of the core mass are conserved in the formation of the star/disk system. We demonstrate that the similarity solution for the surface density for gamma < 0 can explain the properties of some "transitional disks" without requiring discontinuities in the disk surface density. In the case of LkCa 15, a smooth distribution of material from few stellar radii to about 240 AU can produce both the observed spectral energy distribution and the spatially resolved continuum emission at millimeter wavelengths. Finally we show that among the observed sample, TW Hya is the only object that has a disk radius comparable with the early solar nebula.

TI Conjugated Polymers from Naphthalene Bisimide
SO ORGANIC LETTERS
AB Stille coupling of regioisomerically pure dibromonaphthalene bisimides (NBI) with various stannylated thiophene-based monomers yields (very) high molecular weight donor-acceptor conjugated polymers. Electrochemical and optical absorption measurements reveal that LUMO energies are essentially invariant and dictated by the NBI units, while HOMO energies are dictated by the thienyl comonomers. Optical energy gaps ranging from 1.7 to 1.1 eV are thus obtained. The polymers are also characterized by differential scanning calorimetry and fiber WAXD.

TI Hydrogen production by photo-induced reforming of biomass components and
   derivatives at ambient conditions
SO CATALYSIS LETTERS
AB Hydrogen can be produced at ambient conditions via an efficient, technologically simple, ecologically benign, and potentially very low-cost process, with the use of a Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst and three abundant and renewable sources: biomass, solar light, and water. The method combines photocatalytic splitting of water and light-induced oxidation of biomass compounds into a single process, able to produce hydrogen at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.

TI Charge transfer excitons in bulk heterojunctions of a polyfluorene
   copolymer and a fullerene derivative
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB The photophysical properties of blends of fluorene copolymer and the fullerene derivative PCBM are analyzed with a particular attention to photovoltaic applications. The properties of the blends are determined by the relative alignment of the HOMO energy levels. In the blend where the HOMO levels of the copolymer and the fullerene are aligned there is not signature of charge stabilization and photovoltaic effect. While in the blend where there is an offset between the HOMO levels the charge stabilization is accompanied by good photovoltaic performances. The photoluminescence spectrum of the latter blend is characterized by the appearance of a new peak at low energy with a lifetime of a few ns that red-shifts with the increase of the PCBM percentage. The feature is attributed to the emission from a charge-transfer exciton that is red-shifted by the change of dielectric constant of the medium.

TI Nanorod heterostructures showing photoinduced charge separation
SO SMALL
AB Size- and shape-dependent property modifications of semiconductor nanocrystals have been a subject of intense interest because of their potential for future engineering devices. The bandgap and related optical-property timing of these materials are mainly governed by the nature of their band edges. In addition, fusing one type of nanocrystal over another enables further control of material properties that are dependent on the relative alignments of their energy levels. On a molecular scale, the synthesis of supramolecular compounds has inspired advances in theories for photoinduced charge transfer. Heterostructured nanocrystals potentially provide a nanoscale analog of such systems. A method for preparing heterostructured nanocrystals of complex morphologies showing photoinduced charge separation is presented. It is shown that the energy and lifetime of the charge-transfer photoluminescence band can be tuned by changing the relative alignment of band edges in CdSe/CdTe heterostructure nanorods. The long-lived charge transfer states in these type II semiconductors may make them attractive for photovoltaic applications.

TI Theoretical investigation of the excited states of coumarin dyes for
   dye-sensitized solar cells
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A
AB Using time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), configuration interaction single (CIS) method, and approximate coupled cluster singles and doubles (CC2) method, we investigated the absorption spectra of coumarin derivative dyes (C343, NKX-2388, NKX-2311, NKX-2586, and NKX-2677), which have been synthesized for efficient dye-sensitized solar cells. The CC2 calculations are found in good agreement with the experimental results except for the smallest coumarin dye (C343). TD-DFT underestimates the vertical excitation energy of the larger coumarin dyes (NKX-2586 and -2677). Solvents (methanol) are found to induce a red shift of the vertical excitation energies, and their effects on the molecular geometry and the electronic structure are examined in detail. The deprotonated form of coumarin is also investigated, where a blue shift of the vertical excitation energies is observed.

TI Electronic coupling and exciton energy transfer in CdTe quantum-dot
   molecules
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Stable dispersions of molecularlike aggregates of CdTe quantum dots are prepared by chemical cross-linking. Cryo-TEM images confirm the presence of cross-linked quantum dots and show that the size of the small aggregates can be controlled by the amount of cross-linker added. Optical measurements reveal two types of interdot interactions within these quantum-dot molecules: exciton energy transfer and electronic coupling. Quantitative information on the energy transfer rates in quantum-dot molecules is obtained by photoluminescence lifetime measurements. The degree of electronic coupling is dependent on the size of the quantum dots, which is supported by quantum mechanical calculations.

TI Attempt to distinguish long-range temporal correlations from the
   statistics of the increments by natural time analysis
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Self-similarity may originate from two origins: i.e., the process memory and the process' increments "infinite" variance. A distinction is attempted by employing the natural time chi. Concerning the first origin, we analyze recent data on seismic electric signals, which support the view that they exhibit infinitely ranged temporal correlations. Concerning the second, slowly driven systems that emit bursts of various energies E obeying the power-law distribution-i.e., P(E)similar to E(-gamma)-are studied. An interrelation between the exponent gamma and the variance kappa(1)(equivalent to <chi(2)>-<chi >(2)) is obtained for the shuffled (randomized) data. For real earthquake data, the most probable value of kappa(1) of the shuffled data is found to be approximately equal to that of the original data, the difference most likely arising from temporal correlation. Finally, it is found that the differential entropy associated with the probability P(kappa(1)) maximizes for gamma around gamma approximate to 1.6-1.7, which is comparable to the value determined experimentally in diverse phenomena: e.g., solar flares, icequakes, dislocation glide in stressed single crystals of ice, etc. It also agrees with the b value in the Gutenberg-Richter law of earthquakes. In addition, the case of multiplicative cascades is studied in the natural time domain.

TI Life cycle assessment of hydrogen fuel production processes
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB The use of hydrogen as an alternative fuel is gaining more and more acceptance as the environmental impact of hydrocarbons becomes more evident. A life cycle assessment study has been carried out to investigate the environmental aspects of hydrogen production. Production by natural gas steam reforming and production upon renewable energy sources are examined. Hydrogen is selected as a future alternative fuel because of the absence of CO2 emissions from its use, its high-energy content and its combustion kinetics, A very large number of environmental burdens result from he operation of the different hydrogen production routes. A complete and accurate identification and quantification of the environmental emissions has been attempted. The use of wind, hydropower and solar thermal energy for the production of hydrogen are the most environmental benign methods. The benefits and the drawbacks of the competing hydrogen production systems are presented. (C) 2004 International Association for Hydrogen Energy. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Stochastic acceleration of electrons and protons. I. Acceleration by
   parallel-propagating waves
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB Stochastic acceleration of electrons and protons by waves propagating parallel to the large-scale magnetic fields of magnetized plasmas is studied with emphasis on the feasibility of accelerating particles from a thermal background to relativistic energies and with the aim of determining the relative acceleration of the two species in one source. In general, the stochastic acceleration by these waves results in two distinct components in the particle distributions, a quasi-thermal and a hard nonthermal, with the nonthermal one being more prominent in hotter plasmas and/or with higher level turbulence. This can explain many of the observed features of solar flares. Regarding the proton-to-electron ratio, we find that in a pure hydrogen plasma the dominance of the wave-proton interaction by the resonant Alfven mode reduces the acceleration rate of protons in the intermediate energy range significantly, while the electron-cyclotron and Whistler waves are very efficient in accelerating electrons from a few keV to MeV energies. The presence of such an acceleration barrier prohibits the proton acceleration under solar flare conditions. This difficulty is alleviated when we include the effects of He-4 in the dispersion relation and the damping of the turbulent waves by the thermal background plasma. The additional He-4 cyclotron branch of the turbulent plasma waves suppresses the proton acceleration barrier significantly, and the steep turbulence spectrum in the dissipation range makes the nonthermal component have a near power-law shape. The relative acceleration of protons and electrons is very sensitive to a plasma parameter alpha = omega(pe)/Omega(e), where omega(pe) and Omega(e) are the electron plasma frequency and gyrofrequency, respectively. Protons are preferentially accelerated in weakly magnetized plasmas (large alpha). The formalism developed here is applicable to the acceleration of other ion species and to other astrophysical systems.

TI A modeling study on the climate impacts of black carbon aerosols
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
AB A three-dimensional interactive aerosol-climate model has been developed and used to study the climatic impact of black carbon (BC) aerosols. When compared with the model's natural variability, significant global-scale changes caused by BC aerosols occurred in surface latent and sensible heat flux, surface net long-wave radiative flux, planetary boundary layer height, convective precipitation (all negative), and low-cloud coverage (positive), all closely related to the hydrological cycle. The most significant regional change caused by BC revealed in this study is in precipitation that occurs in the tropics (shift of precipitation center in the ITCZ) and in the middle and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere (change in snow depth). Influenced by BC caused changes in cloud cover and surface albedo, the interactive model provides smaller positive all-sky forcing at the top of atmosphere (TOA) and larger negative forcing at the surface than the offline diagnostics (the direct forcings). The actual solar radiative forcings by BC derived from the interactive model also exhibit significant interannual variations that are up to 4 times as large as their means. Based on the revealed changes in cloud radiative forcing by BC, a non-Twomey-Albrecht indirect forcing by BC that alters radiative budgets by changing cloud cover via thermodynamics rather than microphysics is also defined. It has been demonstrated that with an absolute amount more than 2 times higher than that of the TOA forcing, the surface forcing by BC is a very important factor in analyzing the climatic impact of BC. The result of this study suggests that with a constant annual emission of 14 TgC, BC aerosols do not cause a significant change in global-mean surface temperature. The calculated surface temperature change is determined by a subtle balance among changes in surface energy budget as well as in the hydrological cycle, all caused by BC forcing and often compensate each other. The result of this study shows that the influences of BC aerosols on climate and environment are more significant in regional scale than in global scale. Important feedbacks between BC radiative effects and climate dynamics revealed in this study suggest the importance of using interactive aerosol-climate models to address the issues related to the climate impacts of aerosols.

TI Solar neutrino emission deduced from a seismic model
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB Three helioseismic instruments on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory have observed the Sun almost continuously since early 1996. This has led to detailed study of the biases induced by the instruments that measure intensity or Doppler velocity variation. Photospheric turbulence hardly influences the tiny signature of conditions in the energy-generating core in the low-order modes, which are therefore very informative. We use sound-speed and density profiles inferred from GOLF and MDI data including these modes, together with recent improvements to stellar model computations, to build a spherically symmetric seismically adjusted model in agreement with the observations. The model is in hydrostatic and thermal balance and produces the present observed luminosity. In constructing the model, we adopt the best physics available, although we adjust some fundamental ingredients, well within the commonly estimated errors, such as the p-p reaction rate (+1%) and the heavy-element abundance (+3.5%); we also examine the sensitivity of the density profile to the nuclear reaction rates. Then, we deduce the corresponding emitted neutrino fluxes and consequently demonstrate that it is unlikely that the deficit of the neutrino fluxes measured on Earth can be explained by a spherically symmetric classical model without neutrino flavor transitions. Finally, we discuss the limitations of our results and future developments.

TI The determination of gravitational potential differences from
   satellite-to-satellite tracking
SO CELESTIAL MECHANICS & DYNAMICAL ASTRONOMY
AB A new, rigorous model is developed for the difference of gravitational potential between two close earth-orbiting satellites in terms of measured range-rates, velocities and velocity differences, and specific forces. It is particularly suited to regional geopotential determination from a satellite-to-satellite tracking mission. Based on energy considerations, the model specifically accounts for the time variability of the potential in inertial space, principally due to earth's rotation. Analysis shows the latter to be a significant (+/- 1 m(2)/s(2)) effect that overshadows by many orders of magnitude other time dependencies caused by solar and lunar tidal potentials. Also, variations in earth rotation with respect to terrestrial and celestial coordinate frames are inconsequential. Results of simulations contrast the new model to the simplified linear model (relating potential difference to range-rate) and delineate accuracy requirements in velocity vector measurements needed to supplement the range-rate measurements. The numerical analysis is oriented toward the scheduled Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission and shows that an accuracy in the velocity difference vector of 2 x 10(-5) m/s would be commensurate within the model to the anticipated accuracy of 10(-6) m/s in range-rate.

TI Morphology and adsorbate dependence of ionic transport in dye sensitized
   mesoporous TiO2 films
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B
AB By modeling the steady-state mass transport in a thin-layer cell configuration involving an electrochemically inactive mesoporous colloidal film, the limiting currents of an iodine containing electrolyte can be predicted, as a function of the film porosity. The porosity of the layer is then determined by best fit of the porosity parameter in the model, given the experimentally determined limiting currents. Satisfactory agreement is found with the porosity values obtained by BET measurements. In photoelectrochemical cell applications such as dye sensitized nanocrystalline photoelectrodes for solar energy conversion devices, the porosities of the dye loaded films of e.g. anatase TiO2 play an essential role with respect to their efficiency. In particular, the findings of this work demonstrate that the presence of adsorbed sensitizer cis-(SCN-)(2) bis(2,2'-bipyridyl- 4,4'-dicarboxylate)ruthenium(II) in TiO2 colloidal films appears to decrease the original naked film porosity by up to 30%. This depends on the initial bare film porosity and the dye diameter, thus resulting in a considerably lower effective mass-transport limit within the coated films. The effective diffusion coefficient of triiodide in these porous electrodes was found to not deviate significantly with respect to the free-stream values, suggesting an influence of mesoporosity on the transport mechanisms involved.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Cross sections for the Be-7(p,gamma)B-8 reaction have been measured for E-c.m. = 0.35-1.4 MeV using radioactive Be-7 targets. Two independent measurements carried out with different beam conditions, different targets, and detectors are in excellent agreement. A statistical comparison of these measurements with previous results leads to a restricted set of consistent data, The deduced zero-energy S factor S(0) is found to be 15%-20% smaller than the previously recommended value. This implies a B-8 solar neutrino flux lower than previously predicted in various standard solar models. [S0031-9007(97)05137-5].

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
CT ISLSCP (International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project)
   Workshop
CY JUN 23-26, 1992
CL COLUMBIA, MD
AB Shortwave radioative fluxes at the earth's surface are of primary interest in climate research because they control the total energy exchange between the atmosphere and the land/ocean surface. Information on these fluxes is needed on a global scale, and therefore, has to be obtained by methods of remote sensing from observations made with instruments carried on satellites. The primary objective of this paper is to review current capabilities and activities to infer these forcing functions from satellite observations and to discuss future needs. Discussed will be fluxes of downward surface shortwave radiation (DSSR) and net surface shortwave radiation (NSSR), Methods for deriving DSSR fluxes on a global scale are becoming operational. They are being used increasingly to address climate issues, such as in determining the role of solar forcing in oceanic and atmospheric processes, hydrological modeling, and in carbon cycling. Based on extensive comparisons with ground-truth it is believed that estimates of DSSR fluxes can be obtained within 20 Wm(-2) or better on monthly time scales, for areas of an average climate model grid size. Methods for deriving NSSR fluxes seem promising, but need to be further evaluated.

Using the CGS4 spectrometer on the UKIRT telescope, we clearly detected 11 emission features of the H-3+ fundamental vibration-rotation band between 3.89 and 4.09 mum. These features are composed primarily of lines from the Q-branch; the strongest of them is the Q(3) blend at 3.985 mum. Analysis of these features indicates a rotational temperature of 740 +/- 25 K, an ortho-H-3+ fraction of 0.51 +/- 0.03, and a disk-averaged H-3+ column abundance of 6.5 x 10(10) (+/- 10%) molecules cm-2. Comparison is made with Jupiter (the only other planet for which H-3+ has been detected), Saturn, and Neptune. A detection of the H-2 1-0 S(1) line in Uranus and an upper limit to H-3+ emission from Neptune also are reported. The rate of energy deposition into Uranus appears to be significantly higher than the rate reported during the Voyager 2 flyby in January of 1986.

TI COUPLED QUASI-LINEAR WAVE DAMPING AND STOCHASTIC ACCELERATION OF PICKUP
   IONS IN THE SOLAR-WIND
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
AB Coupled spatially homogeneous quasilinear kinetic equations are derived which describe the evolution of the energetic ion omnidirectional distribution function and the intensities of magnetohydrodynamic waves propagating parallel and antiparallel to the ambient magnetic field. The energetic ions are assumed to be nearly isotropic and possess speeds much greater than the Alfven speed.  For application to pickup ions the equations may also include an energetic ion injection rate and wave excitation or damping caused by isotropization of the newborn ions.  The wave kinetic equations may be integrated to yield explicit expressions for the wave intensities, which may be substituted into the ion kinetic equations to yield a single self-consistent energy diffusion equation for the energetic ions.  The theory represents the first treatment of stochastic (second-order Fermi) acceleration in which the back reaction of the ions on the turbulence is included self-consistently.  Numerical solutions of the kinetic equations are presented for four cases of pickup ions in the solar wind which illustrate the essential features of the evolution:  (1) interstellar pickup helium near a heliocentric radial distance of 1 AU; (2) interstellar pickup hydrogen near 10 AU; (3) water group pickup ions downstream of the bow wave of Comet Giacobini-Zinner for parameters observed during the International Cometary Explorer flyby; (4) water group pickup ions downstream of the bow wave of Comet Halley for parameters observed during the Giotto flyby.  The helium calculation reveals some modification of the solar wind wave spectrum and energy diffusion of the ions; although adiabatic deceleration is not included, acceleration rates are qualitatively consistent with the observed spectrum at 1 AU (Mobius et al., 1985). The hydrogen calculation shows extreme damping of the solar wind wave spectrum in the cyclotron-resonant frequency range and a reduction in the acceleration rate of most of the ions.  It is suggested that this behavior is responsible for an underabundance of hydrogen relative to the minor ions in the anomalous cosmic ray component, which is though to originate from pickup ions accelerated at the solar wind termination shock.  Wave damping is small at comet G-Z, and the calculated energy spectra do not appear to be in quantitative agreement with the observed spectra (Richardson et al., 1987).  At Comet Halley, on the other hand, wave damping is substantial and the calculated spectra appear to be in general agreement with the observations (McKenna-Lawlor et al., 1989).

TI Visible Light-Driven H-2 Production by Hydrogenases Attached to
   Dye-Sensitized TiO2 Nanoparticles
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB A study of hybrid, enzyme-modified nanoparticles able to produce H-2 using visible light as the energy source has been carried out to establish per-site performance standards for H-2 production catalysts able to operate under ambient conditions. The [NiFeSe]-hydrogenase from Desulfomicrobium baculatum (Db [NiFeSe]-H) is identified as a particularly proficient catalyst. The optimized system consisting of Db [NiFeSe]-H attached to Ru dye-sensitized TiO2, with triethanolamine as a sacrificial electron donor, produces H-2 at a turnover frequency of approximately 50 (mol H-2) s(-1) (mol total hydrogenase)(-1) at pH 7 and 25 degrees C, even under the typical solar irradiation of a northern European sky. The system shows high electrocatalytic stability not only under anaerobic conditions but also after prolonged exposure to air, thus making it sufficiently robust for benchtop applications.

TI Near-IR Femtosecond Transient Absorption Spectroscopy of Ultrafast
   Polaron and Triplet Exciton Formation in Polythiophene Films with
   Different Regioregularities
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB The formation dynamics of polaron pairs, polarons, and triplet excitons in regiorandom and regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (RRa-P3HT and RR-P3HT) films was comprehensively studied by transient absorption spectroscopy over the wide wavelength region from 500 to 1650 nm under various excitation intensities. In both RRa-P3HT and RR-P3HT films, polaron pairs were generated not from relaxed singlet exciton states but from hot excitons on a time scale of <100 fs and decayed monomolecularly by geminate recombination. In RRa-P3HT films, triplet excitons were rapidly generated on a picosecond time scale from higher exciton states produced by the singlet exciton-exciton annihilation as well as from the lowest singlet exciton states by the normal intersystem crossing. In RR-P3HT films, no triplet excitons were observed; polarons were also generated not from relaxed singlet exciton states but from hot excitons in competition with the formation of polaron pairs. The polarons formed in RR-P3HT can freely migrate and mainly recombine with other polarons bimolecularly in the nanosecond time domain. The ultrafast formation of triplet excitons can be explained by the singlet exciton fission into two triplets, and the ultrafast formation of polaron pairs and polarons can be explained on the basis of the hot-exciton dissociation model where the excess thermal energy of the initially formed hot excitons is necessary to overcome their Coulombic binding energy. The remarkably different formation dynamics in P3HTs with different regioregularities is discussed in terms of the film morphology of conjugated polymers.

TI EPISODIC ACCRETION AT EARLY STAGES OF EVOLUTION OF LOW-MASS STARS AND
   BROWN DWARFS: A SOLUTION FOR THE OBSERVED LUMINOSITY SPREAD IN H-R
   DIAGRAMS?
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS
AB We present evolutionary models for young low-mass stars and brown dwarfs taking into account episodic phases of accretion at early stages of the evolution, a scenario supported by recent large surveys of embedded protostars. An evolution including short episodes of vigorous accretion ((M) over dot >= 10(-4)M(circle dot) yr(-1)) followed by longer quiescent phases ((M) over dot < 10(-6)M(circle dot) yr(-1)) can explain the observed luminosity spread in H-R diagrams of star-forming regions at ages of a few Myr, for objects ranging from a few Jupiter masses to a few tenths of a solar mass. The gravitational contraction of these accreting objects strongly departs from the standard Hayashi track at constant T(eff). The best agreement with the observed luminosity scatter is obtained if most of the accretion shock energy is radiated away. The obtained luminosity spread at 1 Myr in the H-R diagram is equivalent to what can be misinterpreted as an similar to 10 Myr age spread for non-accreting objects. We also predict a significant spread in radius at a given T(eff), as suggested by recent observations. These calculations bear important consequences for our understanding of star formation and early stages of evolution and on the determination of the initial mass function for young (<= a few Myr) clusters. Our results also show that the concept of a stellar birthline for low-mass objects has no valid support.

SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Two organolead halide perovskite nanocrystals, CH(3)NH(3)PbBr(3) and CH(3)NH(3)Pbl(3), were found to efficiently sensitize TiO(2) for visible-light conversion in photoetectrochemical cells. When self-assembled on mesoporous TiO(2) films, the nanocrystattine perovskites exhibit strong band-gap absorptions as semiconductors. The CH(3)NH(3)Pbl(3)-based photocell with spectral sensitivity of up to 800 nm yielded a solar energy conversion efficiency of 3.8%. The CH(3)NH(3)PbBr(3)-based cell showed a high photovoltage of 0.96 V with an external quantum conversion efficiency of 65%.

TI Photovoltaic-active dithienosilole-containing polymers
SO MACROMOLECULES
AB Silole-containing polymers consisting of a dithienosilole homopolymer backbone (12) or an alternating dithienosilole and 4,7-bis(2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole copolymer backbone (13) were synthesized. The presence of planar dithienosilole tricyclic units along these g.-conjugated polymer backbones lowered the band gap and led to strong absorption in the visible region of the solar spectrum. The introduction of electron-withdrawing benzothiadiazole moieties along the dithienosilole backbone further reduced the optical band gap and increased the interchain interaction. Bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells using 1:1 w/w polymer 12 or 13:PCBM (methanofullerene [6.6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester) blends as the photoactive layers were prepared. Photovoltaic cells with copolymer 13 as the electron donor and PCBM as the electron acceptor exhibited an increased energy conversion efficiency by a factor of 3 up to 0.18% under an AM 1.5 simulated solar light at 100 mW/cm(2) after thermal annealing at 140 degrees C.

TI Hierarchical placement and associated optoelectronic impact of carbon
   nanotubes in polymer-fullerene solar cells
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Since their discovery, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been considered to be promising candidates for polymer-based solar cells, but their functional incorporation and utilization in such devices have been limited due to processing bottlenecks. Here, we demonstrate the realization of controlled placement of a single-walled CNT (SWNT) monolayer network at four different positions in polymer-fullerene bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. SWNTs were deposited by dip-coating from a hydrophilic suspension, and a very brief, largely nondestructive argon plasma treatment of the active layer was utilized for incorporation of a SWNT layer within or above it. We demonstrate that SWNTs on the hole-collection side of the active layer lead to an increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the photovoltaic devices from 4 to 4.9% (under AM 1.5 G, 1.3 suns illumination). This is the highest reported PCE for polymer-based solar cells incorporating CNTs, upon consideration of expected scaling of device parameters for 1 sun illumination. We also observe that SWNTs deposited on the top of the active layer lead to major electro-optical changes in the device functionality, including an increased fluorescence lifetime of poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT).

AB The mechanism that nature applies to dissipate excess energy from solar UV light absorption in DNA is fundamental, because its efficiency determines the vulnerability of all genetic material to photodamage and subsequent mutations. Using femtosecond time-resolved broadband spectroscopy, we have traced the electronic excitation in both time and space along the base stack in a series of single-stranded and double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides. The obtained results demonstrate not only the presence of delocalized electronic domains (excitons) as a result of UV light absorption, but also reveal the spatial extent of the excitons.

TI Dust dynamics during protoplanetary disc clearing
SO MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
AB We consider the dynamics of dust and gas during the clearing of protoplanetary discs. We work within the context of a photoevaporation/viscous model for the evolution of the gas disc, and use a two-fluid model to study the dynamics of dust grains as the gas disc is cleared. Small (less than or similar to 10 mu m) grains remain well coupled to the gas, but larger (similar to 1 mm) grains are subject to inward migration from large radii (similar to 50 au), suggesting that the time-scale for grain growth in the outer disc is similar to 10(4)-10(5) yr. We describe in detail the observable appearance of discs during clearing, and find that pressure gradients in the gas disc result in a strong enhancement of the local dust-to-gas ratio in a ring near to the inner disc edge. Lastly, we consider a simple model of the disc-planet interaction, and suggest that observations of disc masses and accretion rates provide a straightforward means of discriminating between different models of disc clearing.

TI Band-offset engineering for enhanced open-circuit voltage in
   polymer-oxide hybrid solar cells
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB The power conversion efficiency of organic and hybrid solar cells is commonly reduced by a low open circuit voltage (V-OC). In these cases, the V-OC is significantly less than the energy of the lowest energy absorbed photon divided by the elementary charge q. The low photovoltage originates from characteristically large band offsets between the electron donor and acceptor species. Here a simple method is reported to systematically tune the hand offset in a pi-conjugated polymer metal oxide hybrid donor-acceptor system in order to maximise the V-OC. It is demonstrated that substitution of magnetisim into a zinc oxide acceptor (ZnMgO) reduces the band offset and results in a substantial increase in the V-OC of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (3HT) ZnMgO planar devices. The V-OC is seen to increase from 500 mV at x = 0 up to value in excess of 900 mV for x = 0.35. A concomitant increase in overall device efficiency is seen as x is increased from 0 to 0.25 with a maximum power-conversation efficiency of 0.5% obtained at x = 0.25, beyond which the efficiency decreases because of increased series resistance in the device. This work provides a new tool for understanding the role of the donor-acceptor band offset in hybrid photovoltaics and for maximising the photovoltage and power-conversion efficiency in such devices.

SO NANO LETTERS
AB A Li+ coordinating sensitizer, NaRu(4-carboxylic acid-4'-carboxylate)(4,4'-bis[(triethylene glycol methyl ether) methyl ether]-2,2'-bipyridine)(NCS)(2) (coded as K51), has been synthesized, and the effect of Li+ coordination on its performance in mesoscopic titanium dioxide dye-sensitized solar cells has been investigated. Fourier transform infrared spectra suggest that Li+ coordinates to the triethylene oxide methyl ether side chains on the dye molecules. With the addition of Li+ to a nonvolatile liquid electrolyte, we observe a significant increase in the photocurrent density, with only a small decrease in the open-circuit voltage, contrary to a non ion coordinating dye which displays a large drop in potential with the addition of Li+. For a solar cell incorporating an organic hole-transporter, we find the potential rises with increasing the Li+ concentration in the hole-transporter matrix. For the liquid electrolyte and solid-state cells, we obtain power conversion efficiencies of 7.8% and 3.8%, respectively, under simulated sunlight.

AB Molecules bearing a 4,4-di-fluoro-8-(aryl)-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-2,6-diethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (bodipy) core and 1-pyrenyl-1-phenyl4-(1-ethynylpyrene), or 1-phenyl-4-[1-ethynyl-(6-ethynylpyrene)pyrene] units were constructed in a step-by-step procedure based on palladium(0)-promoted cross-coupling reactions with the required preconstructed modules. X-ray structures of single crystals reveal a twisted arrangement of the two chromophores. In one case, an almost perfect orthogonal arrangement is found. These dyes are strongly luminescent in solution and display rich electrochemistry in which all redox processes of the bodipy and pyrene fragments are clearly resolved. The absorption spectra indicate that the bodipy and pyrene chromophores are spectrally isolated, thereby inducing a large "virtual" Stokes shift. The latter is realised by efficient transfer of intramolecular excitation energy by the Forster dipole-dipole mechanism. The rate of energy transfer depends on the structure of the dual-dye system and decreases as the centre-to-centre separation increases. The energy transfer efficiency, however, exceeds 90% in all cases. The linkage of two pyrene residues by an ethyne group leads to a decrease in the energy-transfer efficiency, with the two polycycles acting as a single chromophore. The directly linked bodipy-pyrene dual dye binds to DNA and operates as an efficient solar concentrator when dispersed in plastic.

TI The effect of tidal locking on the magnetospheric and atmospheric
   evolution of "Hot Jupiters"
SO ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
AB We study the interaction between the planetary magnetosphere and atmosphere of the close-in extrasolar planets HD 209458b and OGLE-TR-56b with the stellar wind during the evolution of their host stars. Recent astrophysical observations of solar-like stars indicate that the radiation and particle environments of young stars are orders of magnitudes larger than for stars with ages comparable to the sun (similar to4.6 Gyr). We model the interaction for the present and for early evolutionary stages, showing that it is possible that "Hot Jupiters" have an ionosphere-stellar wind interaction like Venus. Our study suggests that the internal magnetic field of exoplanets orbiting close to their host stars may be very weak due to tidal locking. The magnetic moments can be less than one tenth of the value presently observed for the rapidly rotating planet Jupiter. We find that the stronger stellar wind of younger solar-type stars compresses the magnetosphere to a standoff distance at which the ionized part of the upper atmosphere, hydrodynamically expanded by the XUV-flux, builds an obstacle. Because of a much larger stellar wind particle flux during the first similar to0.5 Gyr after the host stars arrived on the Zero-Age-Main-Sequence, "Hot Jupiters" may have not been protected by their intrinsic magnetic fields, even if one neglects the effect of tidal locking. In such a case, the unshielded upper atmosphere will be affected by different ionization and non-thermal ion loss processes. This contributes to the estimated neutral hydrogen loss rates of about greater than or equal to10(10) g/s of the observed expanded exosphere of HD 209458b (Vidal-Madjar et al. 2003) and will be an ionized part of the estimated upper energy-limited neutral hydrogen loss rates of about 10(12) g/s (Lammer et al. 2003a).

TI Excitonic coupling in polythiophenes: Comparison of different
   calculation methods
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB In conjugated polymers the optical excitation energy transfer is usually described as Forster-type hopping between so-called spectroscopic units. In the simplest approach using the point-dipole approximation the transfer rate is calculated based on the interaction between the transition dipoles of two spectroscopic units. In the present work we compare this approach with three others: The line-dipole approximation, the Coulomb integral between the transition densities, and a quantum-chemical calculation of the interacting dimer as entity. The latter two approaches are based on the semiempirical method ZINDO. The line-dipole approximation is an attractive compromise between computational effort and precision for calculations of the excitonic coupling in extended conjugated polymers.

TI Nonlinear outcome of gravitational instability in disks with realistic
   cooling
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB We consider the nonlinear outcome of gravitational instability in optically thick disks with a realistic cooling function. We use a numerical model that is local, razor thin, and unmagnetized. External illumination is ignored. Cooling is calculated from a one-zone model using analytic fits to low-temperature Rosseland mean opacities. The model has two parameters: the initial surface density Sigma(0) and the rotation frequency Omega. We survey the parameter space and find the following. (1) The disk fragments when [[tau(c)]] Omega similar to 1, where [[tau(c)]] is an effective cooling time defined as the average internal energy of the model divided by the average cooling rate. This is consistent with earlier results that used a simplified cooling function. (2) The initial cooling time tau(c0) for a uniform disk with Q = 1 can differ by orders of magnitude from [[tau(c)]] in the nonlinear outcome. The difference is caused by sharp variations in the opacity with temperature. The condition tau(c0)Omegasimilar to 1 therefore does not necessarily indicate where fragmentation will occur. (3) The largest difference between [[tau(c)]] and tau(c0) is near the opacity gap, where dust is absent and hydrogen is largely molecular. ( 4) In the limit of strong illumination the disk is isothermal; we. nd that an isothermal version of our model fragments for Q less than or similar to 1.4. Finally, we discuss some physical processes not included in our model and. nd that most are likely to make disks more susceptible to fragmentation. We conclude that disks with [[tau(c)]] Omega less than or similar to 1 do not exist.

TI Carbon emission and mitigation cost comparisons between fossil fuel,
   nuclear and renewable energy resources for electricity generation
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB A Study was conducted to compare the electricity generation costs of a number of current commercial technologies with technologies expected to become commercially available within the coming decade or so. The amount of greenhouse gas emissions resulting per kWh of electricity generated were evaluated. A range of fossil fuel alternatives (with and without physical carbon sequestration). were compared with the baseline case of a pulverised coal, steam cycle power plant. Nuclear. hydro, wind, bioenergy and solar generating, plants were also evaluated. The objectives were to assess the comparative costs of mitigation per tonne of carbon emissions avoided. and to estimate the total amount of carbon mitigation that could result from the global electricity sector by 2010 and 2020 as a result of fuel switching, carbon dioxide sequestration and the greater uptake of renewable energy. Most technologies showed potential to reduce both generating costs and carbon emission avoidance by 2020 with tile exception of solar power and carbon dioxide sequestration. The global electricity industry has potential to reduce its carbon emissions by over 15% by 2020 together with cost saving benefits compared with existing generation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI The r-process in supernova explosions from the collapse of O-Ne-Mg cores
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB While the origin of r-process nuclei remains a long-standing mystery, recent spectroscopic studies of extremely metal poor stars in the Galactic halo strongly suggest that it is associated with core-collapse supernovae. In this study we examine r-process nucleosynthesis in a "prompt supernova explosion" from an 8-10 M-circle dot progenitor star as an alternative scenario to the "neutrino wind" mechanism, which has also been considered a promising site of the r-process. In the present model, the progenitor star has formed an oxygen-neon-magnesium (O-Ne-Mg) core (of mass 1.38 M-circle dot) at its center. Its smaller gravitational potential, as well as the smaller core that is in nuclear statistical equilibrium at the time of core bounce, as compared with the iron cores in more massive stars, may allow the star to explode hydrodynamically rather than by delayed neutrino heating. The core-collapse simulations are performed with a one-dimensional, Newtonian hydrodynamic code. We obtain a very weak prompt explosion in which no r-processing occurs. We further simulate energetic prompt explosions by enhancement of the shock-heating energy in order to investigate conditions necessary for the production of r-process nuclei in such events. The r-process nucleosynthesis is calculated using a nuclear reaction network code including relevant neutron-rich isotopes with reactions among them. The highly neutronized ejecta (Y-e approximate to 0.14-0.20) lead to robust production of r-process nuclei; their relative abundances are in excellent agreement with the solar r-process pattern. Our results suggest that prompt explosions of 8-10 M-circle dot stars with O-Ne-Mg cores can be a promising site of r-process nuclei. The mass of the r-process material per event is about 2 orders of magnitude larger than that expected from Galactic chemical evolution studies. We propose, therefore, that only a small fraction of r-process material is ejected via "mixing-fallback" mechanism of the core matter, wherein most of the r-process material falls back onto the proto-neutron star. A lower limit on the age of the universe is derived by application of the uranium-thorium (U-Th) chronometer pair by comparison with the observed ratio of these species in the highly r-process-enhanced, extremely metal poor star CS 31082-001. The inferred age is 14.1 +/- 2.4 Gyr - the same as that obtained previously based on the neutrino wind scenario with the same nuclear mass formula. This suggests that chronometric estimates obtained using the U-Th pair are independent of the astrophysical conditions considered.

TI The first substellar subdwarf? Discovery of a metal-poor L dwarf with
   halo kinematics
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB We present the discovery of the first L-type subdwarf, 2MASS J05325346+8246465. This object exhibits enhanced collision-induced H(2) absorption, resulting in blue near-infrared (NIR) colors (J-K(s) = 0.26 +/- 0.16). In addition, strong hydride bands in the red optical and NIR, weak TiO absorption, and an optical/J-band spectral morphology similar to the L7 DENIS 0205-1159AB imply a cool, metal-deficient atmosphere. We find that 2MASS 0532+8246 has both a high proper motion, mu = 2."60 +/- 0."15 yr(-1), and a substantial radial velocity, v(rad) = -195 +/- 11 km s(-1), and its probable proximity to the Sun ( d = 10 30 pc) is consistent with halo membership. Comparison to subsolar-metallicity evolutionary models strongly suggests that 2MASS 0532+8246 is substellar, with a mass of 0.077 less than or similar to M less than or similar to 0.085 M. for ages 10-15 Gyr and metallicities Z = 0.1-0.01 Z. The discovery of this object clearly indicates that star formation occurred below the hydrogen burning mass limit at early times, consistent with prior results indicating a. at or slightly rising mass function for the lowest mass stellar subdwarfs. Furthermore, 2MASS 0532+8246 serves as a prototype for a new spectral class of subdwarfs, additional examples of which could be found in NIR proper-motion surveys.

TI Formation and development of shock waves in the solar corona and the
   near-Sun interplanetary space
SO ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
AB At the Sun, shock waves are produced either by flares and/or by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and are regarded as the source of solar energetic particle events. They can be able to generate solar type II radio bursts. The non-radial propagation of a disturbance is considered away from an active region through the corona into the interplanetary space by evaluating the spatial behaviour of the Alfven speed. The magnetic field of an active region is modelled by a magnetic dipole superimposed on that of the quiet Sun. Such a magnetic field structure leads to a local minimum of the Alfven speed in the range 1.2-1.8 solar radii in the corona as well as a maximum of 740 km s(-1) at a distance of 3.8 solar radii. The occurrence of such local extrema has important consequences for the formation and development of shock waves in the corona and the near-Sun interplanetary space and their ability to accelerate particles. It leads to a temporal delay of the onset of solar energetic particle events with respect to both the initial energy release (flare) and the onset of the solar type II radio burst.

TI Clusters in the inner spiral arms of M 51: The cluster IMF and the
   formation history
SO ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
AB We present the results of an analysis of the HST-WFPC2 observations of the interacting galaxy M 51. From the observations in 5 broadband filters (UBVR1) and two narrowband filters (Halpha and [OIII]) we study the cluster population in a region of 3.2 x 3.2 kpc(2) in the inner spiral arms of M51, at a distance of about 1 to 3 kpc from the nucleus. We found 877 cluster candidates and we derived their ages, initial masses and extinctions by means of a comparison between the observed spectral energy distribution and the predictions from cluster synthesis models for instantaneous star formation and solar metallicity. The lack of [OIII] emission in even the youngest clusters with strong Halpha emission, indicates the absence of the most massive stars and suggests a mass upper limit of about 25 to 30 M.. The mass versus age distribution of the clusters shows a drastic decrease in the number of clusters with age, much more severe than can be expected on the basis of evolutionary fading of the clusters. This indicates that cluster dispersion is occurring on a timescale of 10 Myr or longer. The cluster initial mass function has been derived from clusters younger than 10 Myr by a linear regression fit of the cumulative mass distribution. This results in an exponent alpha = -d log N(M)/d log (M) = 2.1 +/- 0.3 in the range of 2.5 x 10(3) < M < 5 x 10(4) M. but with an overabundance of clusters with M > 2 x 10(4) M.. In the restricted range of 2.5 x 10(3) < M <2 x 10(4) M,, we find alpha = 2.0 +/- 0.05. This exponent is very similar to the value derived for clusters in the interacting Antennae galaxies, and to the exponent of the mass distribution of the giant molecular clouds in our Galaxy. To study the possible effects of the interaction of M51 with its companion NGC 5195 about 400 Myr ago, which triggered a huge starburst in the nucleus, we determined the cluster formation rate as a function of time for clusters with an initial mass larger than 10(4) M.. There is no evidence for a peak in the cluster formation rate at around 200 to 400 Myr ago within 2 sigma accuracy, i.e. within a factor two. The formation rate of the detected clusters decreases strongly with age by about a factor 10(2) between 10 Myr and 1 Gyr. For clusters older than about 150 Myr this is due to the evolutionary fading of the clusters below the detection limit. For clusters younger than 100 Myr this is due to the dispersion of the clusters, unless one assumes that the cluster formation rate has been steadily increasing with time from 1 Gyr ago to the present time.

CL KARLSRUHE, GERMANY
AB The 'all vanadium redox flow system' is a promising candidate for the storage of photovoltaic energy. The reversible cell voltage of 1.3-1.4 V in charged state is well established at various electrode materials in particular carbon based substrate. The kinetics and mechanism were studied for the V2 +/V3 + and VO+ +/VO2+(V4 +/V5+) couples and a one-electron transfer identified as the rate-determining step at smooth surface. The use of activation layers (carbon cloth, felt, etc.) decisively reduced the polarization. Catalysts, which are required for an increase of the reaction rate and the elimination of undesired side reactions, e.g. RU(O)(2) improved the behavior of the positive electrode. The influence of the separator material on mass transfer phenomena (diffusion, migration) and the charge-discharge characteristics were investigated. The requirements to be met as stand alone batteries for the energy supply of users in combination with photovoltaic plants considering the solar irradiation conditions in south Portugal were discussed and the future development goals defined.

TI Minority carrier lifetime degradation in boron-doped Czochralski silicon
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The minority carrier lifetime in boron-doped oxygen-contaminated Czochralski (Cz) silicon is strongly reduced under illumination or carrier injection. This process can be fully reversed by a 200 degreesC anneal step. In several recent studies it was shown that boron and oxygen are the major components of the underlying metastable Cz-specific defect. The energy level of the defect in its active state A was determined to be around midgap [Schmidt , J. Appl. Phys. 86, 3175 (1999)] while the energy level of the defect in its passive state P is very shallow. The Cz-specific defect in its passive state can be identified with the shallow thermal donor. The kinetics of the excess carrier-induced transformation from state P to state A can be described using recombination-enhanced defect reaction theory. On the basis of these experimental facts different solutions for the reduction or elimination of the metastable defect are suggested. Two promising solutions are discussed in more detail: the use of gallium-doped Cz silicon and the introduction of high-temperature anneals into the process sequence. Gallium-doped Cz silicon shows no degradation and excellent lifetimes over a wide resistivity range, although the concentration of interstitial oxygen is in the same range as in standard Cz silicon. Stable solar cell efficiencies comparable to FZ silicon have been achieved. If standard boron-doped Cz silicon is used, the defect concentration can be reduced permanently by a high-temperature anneal using conventional tube or rapid thermal processing. This leads to an improvement of the carrier lifetime by a factor of 2-3. Nevertheless, it is always necessary to use an optimized set of process parameters because otherwise the lifetime of all oxygen-contaminated materials (including gallium-doped Cz silicon) is severely reduced (C) 2001 American Institute of Physics.

TI Modeling the evolution of disk galaxies. II. Yields of massive stars
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB Checking stellar yields with galactic chemical evolution models is an important test of stellar nucleosynthesis simulations. This is generally done by applying a very simple galactic model with a large number of free parameters. It is, however, at least questionable whether such a model can serve as a dependable test of stellar nucleosynthesis. A self-consistent galactic model, on the other hand, can be used to determine yields that are consistent with the galactic chemical evolution. The chemodynamical model introduced in this paper includes a detailed description of the stellar metal-dependent enrichment and serves to determine the chemical yields of massive stars. It shows that the metal dependency of stellar nucleosynthesis, gas hows in the galaxy, mixing processes in the interstellar medium, and the energy release of supernovae (SNe) have a great influence on the distribution of chemical elements. From the chemodynamical model and the observed evolution of [alpha/Fe], I find that on average, one out of 195 intermediate-mass stars explodes as a SN of Type Ia. This yields a ratio of Type Ia SN to Type LT + Ib SN of 1:8.5. Furthermore, the model predicts present SN rates in our Galaxy for Types Ia and II + Ib of 1/107 yr and 1/41 yr, respectively. I present Galactic yields of 23 different chemical elements from C to Ni. One important result is that the yields of Cr, Fe, and Ni are a factor of 2 too high, and odd-z element yields are systematically underestimated in the nucleosynthesis models of massive stars. A comparison of the stellar with the Galactic yields suggests that the lower mass limit for stars to become Type II SNe may be 11 M-., and that the core collapse of stars more massive than 30-40 M-. produces a black hole. The model predicts 1.2-1.5 x 10(9) stellar remnants of massive stars (neutron stars and black holes) in our Galaxy.

TI The evolution of Galactic boron and the production site of the light
   elements
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB The Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS) of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been used to obtain spectra of the 2500 Angstrom region in eight stars with metallicities ranging from [Fe/H] = -0.4 to -3.0, including the most metal-poor star ever observed for boron. Spectrum synthesis utilizing latest Kurucz model atmospheres has been used to determine the B abundance for each star, with particular attention paid to the errors of each point, to permit judgment of the quality of the fit of models of Galactic chemical evolution. Previous observations were combined with new ones, bringing the number of stars analyzed to 11.
   A straight line of slope approximate to 1 gives an excellent fit to a plot(4) of log epsilon(B-LTE) versus [Fe/H], and if NLTE B abundances are used, the slope is approximate to 0.7. Plotting B versus [O/H] rather than [Fe/H] increases the slope of either plot by about 0.2. The observed relation suggests that the production of light elements such as B and Be is directly related to the production of heavier elements.
   Our data do not show a change in slope between halo and disk metallicities, but the number of stars near the disk-halo transition is small, and a modest change is not precluded. The NLTE B/Be ratio is typically approximate to 15 throughout the lifetime of the Galaxy, a ratio naturally produced by cosmic-ray (CR) spallation. Our data support a model in which most light-element production comes from low-energy CR spallation of C and O nuclei onto protons and alpha-particles, probably in the vicinity of massive supernovae in star-forming regions. Until recently, most models have emphasized light-element production in the general ISM from the spallation of high-energy protons and alpha-particles onto CNO nuclei. Especially during the Galaxy's early history, when the metallicity of the ISM was low, the spallation of protons and alpha-particles onto CNO nuclei cannot account for as much B as we observe, unless the CR flux was sufficiently high for compensation. The observed relation also constrains any direct production of B by the nu-process in supernovae to be at most a small part of total B production.
   It is possible that the gamma rays recently detected from the Orion Nebula region are the signature of spallation by energetic C and O nuclei. Nevertheless, B, Be, and Fe data alone give the strongest evidence of the importance of spallation by C and O for producing light elements.

TI AEROGELS
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CERAMIC SOCIETY
AB The first aerogels were made by S. S. Kistler in 1931. Aerogels are produced by a sol-gel process followed by super-critical drying of the wet gel in an autoclave. Their porosity extends from about 1 to 100 nm, which is the reason why properly made aerogels are highly transparent. Aerogels have a spongelike, open-pore structure with a large inner surface. Monolithic aerogels are used in Cerenkov detectors in high-energy physics; several houses have been insulated with layers of translucent granular aerogels for the purpose of passive solar energy usage; opacified aerogel powders are being tested as substitutes for chlorofluorocarbon-blown polyurethane foams and as thermal superinsulations in heat-storage systems; experiments have been performed with aerogels as catalytic substrates, acoustic impedance matching layers, precursors for high-quality glasses, containment for fusion fuels, and gas filters; and aerogels are used in radioluminescent light and energy sources. The attraction that these low-density materials exert on physicists, chemists, and material scientists is recognized from the upsurge of publications on aerogels: about 200 papers are currently published per year. Recently, the periodical Science has rated aerogels as one of the top ten scientific and technological developments.

TI Synthesis of M@TiO2 (M = Au, Pd, Pt) Core-Shell Nanoconnposites with
   Tunable Photoreactivity
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB The core-shell nanocomposites of M@TiO2 (M = Au, Pd, Pt) have been synthesized successfully via a facile hydrothermal treatment of TiF4 precursor and noble metal colloid particles. Their properties were determined by a collection of joint techniques, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction spectra (XRD), ultraviolet/visible diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS), photoluminescence spectra (PL), and electron spin resonance spectra (ESR). Photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) in the liquid phase served as a probe reaction to evaluate the activity of the as-prepared M@TiO2 (M = Au, Pd, Pt) core-shell nanocomposites under the irradiation of both visible light and ultraviolet (UV) light. The results reveal that these core shell nanocomposites possess tunable photoreactivity. It is interesting to find that the incorporation of noble metal core into the shell of TiO2 only contributes to enhancement of visible light photocatalytic activity of TiO2. The noble metal cores are believed to play an essential role in affecting the photoreactivity because they are able to trap electrons, improve the electron hole pairs life, and enhance the visible light absorption intensity that are all beneficial for enhancement of the visible light photocatalytic activity of TiO2. However, the incorporation of noble metal core significantly lowers the UV light absorption intensity, thus leading to the obervation that, under UV light irradiation, the bare TiO2 still exhibits higher activity than M@TiO2 core-shell nanocomposites. The possible radical species involved in the degradation of RhB were analyzed by means of the PL and ESR techniques. Recycled activity tests demonstrate that the incorporation of metal core into the shell of TiO2 will inhibit the photocorrison behavior and provide much better photocatalytic stability of M@TiO2 (M = Au, Pd, Pt) nano composites than the bare TiO2. It is hoped that our work could render guided information for steering toward the design and application of TiO2-coated core-shell nanomaterials with tunable photocatalytic activity.

TI Molecular Design of Unsymmetrical Squaraine Dyes for High Efficiency
   Conversion of Low Energy Photons into Electrons Using TiO2
   Nanocrystalline Films
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB An optimized unsymmetrical squaraine dye 5-carboxy-2[[3-[(2,3-dihydro-1, 1-dimethyl-3-ethyl-1H-benzo[e]indol-2-ylidene)methyl]-2-hydroxy-4-oxo-2-cyclobuten-1-ylidene]methyl]-3,3-dimethyl-1-octyl-3H-indolium (SQ02) with carboxylic acid as anchoring group is synthesized for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Although the pi-framework of SQ02 is insignificantly extended compared to its antecessor squaraine dye SQ01, photophysical measurements show that the new sensitizer has a much higher overall conversion efficiency eta of 5.40% which is improved by 20% when compared to SQ01. UV-vis spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and time dependent density functional theory calculations are accomplished to rationalize the higher conversion efficiency of SQ02. A smaller optical band gap including a higher molar absorption coefficient leads to improved light harvesting of the solar cell and a broadened photocurrent spectrum. Furthermore, all excited state orbitals relevant for the pi-pi* transition in SQ02 are delocalized over the carboxylic acid anchoring group, ensuring a strong electronic coupling to the conduction band of TiO2 and hence a fast electron transfer.

TI Photovoltage Improvement for Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells via Cone-Shaped
   Structural Design
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB In this article, three truexene-based dyes with 2-cyanoacrylic acid as acceptor and starburst triarylamine as donor (S5, S6, and S7) were conveniently synthesized and used for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). A compact sensitizer layer is molecular interfacially engineered on the TiO(2) surface via cone-shaped sensitizers. As a result, the approach of the electrolyte to the TiO(2) surface is blocked significantly by the compact sensitizer layer formed and the charge recombination in the DSSCs is proved to be retarded effectively. The monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency of these sensitizers is near 90%. In addition, S7-sensitized solar cells yield an open-circuit voltage of 752 mV and it fill factor of 0.70, which are even higher than those of N719 under the same conditions.

TI Phase Transformation of Biphasic Cu2S-CuInS2 to Monophasic CuInS2
   Nanorods
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB We synthesized wurtzite CuInS2 nanorods (NRs) by colloidal solution-phase growth. We discovered that the growth process starts with nucleation of Cu2S nanodisks, followed by epitaxial overgrowth of CuInS2 NRs onto only one face of Cu2S nanodisks, resulting in biphasic Cu2S-ClSu heterostructured NRs. The phase transformation of biphasic Cu2S-CuInS2 into monophasic CuInS2 NRs occurred with growth progression. The observed epitaxial overgrowth and phase transformation is facile for three reasons. First, the sharing of the sulfur sublattice by the hexagonal chalcocite Cu2S and wurtzite CuInS2 minimizes the lattice distortion. Second, Cu2S is in a superionic conducting state at the growth temperature of 250 degrees C wherein the copper ions move fluidly. Third, the size of the Cu2S nanodisks is small, resulting in fast phase transformation. Our results provide valuable insight into the controlled solution growth of ternary chalcogenide nanoparticles and will aid in the development of solar cells using ternary I-III-VI2 semiconductors.

TI New routes to sustainable photovoltaics: evaluation of Cu2ZnSnS4 as an
   alternative absorber material
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS
AB Thin film heterojunction solar cells based on chalcopyrites such as Cu(In, Ga)Se-2 have acheived impressive efficiencies. However concern about the long term sustainability of photo-voltaics based on scarce or expensive raw materials has prompted the search for alternative absorber materials. In this work, films of the p-type absorber Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) were prepared by electroplating metallic precursors sequentially onto a molybdenym coated glass substrate followed by an nealing in a sulfur atmosphere. The polycrystalline CZTS films were characterized by photoelectrochemical methods, which showed films were p-type with doping densities of the order of 10(16) cm(-3) and a band gap of 1.49 eV, close to the optimum value for terrestrial solar energy conversion. Preliminary results obtained for solar cells fabricated with this material are promising. (c) 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KgaA, Weinheim.

TI [FeFe]-Hydrogenase-Catalyzed H(2) production in a photoelectrochemical
   biofuel cell
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB The Clostridium acetobutylicum [FeFe]-hydrogenase HydA has been investigated as a hydrogen production catalyst in a photoelectrochemical biofuel cell. Hydrogenase was adsorbed to pyrolytic graphite edge and carbon felt electrodes. Cyclic voltammograms of the immobilized hydrogenase films reveal cathodic proton reduction and anodic hydrogen oxidation, with a catalytic bias toward hydrogen evolution. When corrected for the electrochemically active surface area, the cathodic current densities are similar for both carbon electrodes, and similar to 40% of those obtained with a platinum electrode. The high surface area carbon felt/hydrogenase electrode was subsequently used as the cathode in a photoelectrochemical biofuel cell. Under illumination, this device is able to oxidize a biofuel substrate and reduce protons to hydrogen. Similar photocurrents and hydrogen production rates were observed in the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell using either hydrogenase or platinum cathodes.

TI Nonlinear force-free modeling of coronal magnetic fields. II. Modeling a
   filament arcade and simulated chromospheric and photospheric vector
   fields
SO SOLAR PHYSICS
AB We compare a variety of nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolation algorithms, including optimization, magneto-frictional, and Grad - Rubin-like codes, applied to a solar-like reference model. The model used to test the algorithms includes realistic photospheric Lorentz forces and a complex field including a weakly twisted, right helical flux bundle. The codes were applied to both forced "photospheric" and more force-free "chromospheric" vector magnetic field boundary data derived from the model. When applied to the chromospheric boundary data, the codes are able to recover the presence of the flux bundle and the field's free energy, though some details of the field connectivity are lost. When the codes are applied to the forced photospheric boundary data, the reference model field is not well recovered, indicating that the combination of Lorentz forces and small spatial scale structure at the photosphere severely impact the extrapolation of the field. Preprocessing of the forced photospheric boundary does improve the extrapolations considerably for the layers above the chromosphere, but the extrapolations are sensitive to the details of the numerical codes and neither the field connectivity nor the free magnetic energy in the full volume are well recovered. The magnetic virial theorem gives a rapid measure of the total magnetic energy without extrapolation though, like the NLFFF codes, it is sensitive to the Lorentz forces in the coronal volume. Both the magnetic virial theorem and the Wiegelmann extrapolation, when applied to the preprocessed photospheric boundary, give a magnetic energy which is nearly equivalent to the value derived from the chromospheric boundary, but both underestimate the free energy above the photosphere by at least a factor of two. We discuss the interpretation of the preprocessed field in this context. When applying the NLFFF codes to solar data, the problems associated with Lorentz forces present in the low solar atmosphere must be recognized: the various codes will not necessarily converge to the correct, or even the same, solution.

TI Nitrogen-doped and CdSe quantum-dot-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2
   films for solar energy conversion applications
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Nitrogen-doped titanium dioxide (TiO2/N) nanoparticle thin films have been produced by a sol-gel method with hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) as the dopant source. The synthesized TiO2/N thin films have been sensitized with CdSe quantum dots (QDs) via a linking molecule, thioglycolic acid (TGA). Optical, morphological, structural, and photocurrent properties of the thin films with and without QD sensitization have been characterized by AFM, TEM, XPS, Raman spectroscopy, UV-visible spectroscopy, and photoelectrochemistry techniques. AFM measurements reveals that films with thicknesses of 150 and 1100 nm can be readily. prepared, with an average TiO2 particle size of 100 nm. TEM shows a uniform size distribution of CdSe QDs utilized in sensitizing the TiO2/N films. Doping of the TiO2 crystal lattice by HMT was confirmed to be 0.6-0.8% by XPS. Differences in crystal phase caused by the precursors HMT, nitric acid, and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) are elucidated using XRD and Raman spectroscopy. The resultant crystal phase of TiO2/N varies but is a mixture of anatase, brookite, and rutile phases. UV-visible absorption spectra show that N doping of TiO2 causes a red-shifted absorption into the visible region, with an onset around 600 nm. Nitrogen doping is also responsible for the enhanced photocurrent response of the TiO2/N nanoparticle films in the visible region relative to undoped TiO2 films. In addition, CdSe QDs linked to TiO2/N nanoparticles using TGA were found to significantly increase the photocurrent and power conversion of the films compared to standard TiO2/N films without QD sensitization. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) is 6% at 400 nm for TiO2/N-TGA-CdSe solid-state solar cells and 95% for TiO2/N-TGA-CdSe films near 300 nm in a Na2S electrolyte, which is much higher than that of undoped TiO2 With QD sensitization or TiO2/N without QD sensitization. The power conversion efficiency (q) was found to be 0.84% with a fill factor (FF%) of 27.7% with 1100 nm thick TiO2/N-TGA-CdSe thin films. The results show that combining nitrogen doping with the QD sensitization of TiO2 thin films is an effective and promising way to enhance the photoresponse in the near-UV and visible region, which is important for potential photovoltaic (PV) and photoelectrochemical applications.

TI Cosmic ray induced ionization in the atmosphere: Full modeling and
   practical applications
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
AB We present a physical model to calculate cosmic ray induced ionization in the atmosphere. The model is based on the Monte Carlo CORSIKA tool, which simulates full development of an electromagnetic- muon- nucleonic cascade in the atmosphere, with the FLUKA package used for low- energy interactions. The direct ionization by primary cosmic rays is explicitly taken into account. The model is applicable to the entire atmosphere, from the ground up to the stratosphere. A comparison to fragmentary direct measurements of the ionization in the atmosphere confirms the validity of the model in the whole range of geographical latitudes and altitudes. Results of the full Monte Carlo simulation are tabulated in a form of the ionization yield function. These tables are given together with a detailed recipe, which allows a user to compute easily the cosmic ray induced ionization for given location, altitude and the spectrum of cosmic rays. This provides a new tool for a quantitative study of the space weather influence upon the Earth's environment. Some practical applications are discussed.

TI Efficient organic photovoltaic devices using a combination of exciton
   blocking layer and anodic buffer layer
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB By using bathophenanthroline (BPhen) as an exciton blocking layer (EBL) at the organic/cathode contact of a standard copper phthalocyanine/C-60 organic photovoltaic (OPV) device, power conversion efficiency was substantially increased from 0.86% to 2.64%. The BPhen-based devices showed a 45% increase in power conversion efficiency over that of an equivalent device with an EBL of bathocuproine. The performance improvement was analyzed in terms of the electron energy levels, optical transparencies and electron mobilities of the two EBLs. Based on these results, the roles of and requirements for an effective EBL were discussed. Combining the use of BPhen and a WO3 anodic buffer layer further increased the power conversion efficiency of the OPV device to 3.33%. (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics.

TI Testing the locality of transport in self-gravitating accretion discs -
   II. The massive disc case
SO MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
AB In this paper, we extend our previous analysis (Paper I) of the transport properties induced by gravitational instabilities in cooling, gaseous accretion discs to the case where the disc mass is comparable to the central object. In order to do so, we have performed global, three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of massive discs. These new simulations show a much more complex temporal evolution with respect to the less massive case. Whereas in the case of low disc mass a self-regulated, marginally stable state (characterized by an approximately constant radial profile of the stability parameter Q) is easily established, in the case of high disc mass we observe the development of an initial transient and subsequent settling down in a self-regulated state in some simulations, or a series or recurrent spiral episodes, with low azimuthal wavenumber m, in others. Accretion in this last case can therefore be a highly variable process. On the other hand, we find that the secular evolution of the disc is relatively slow. In fact, the time average of the stress induced by self-gravity results in accretion time-scales much longer than the dynamical time-scale, in contrast with previous isothermal simulations of massive accretion discs. We have also compared the resulting stress tensor with the expectations based on a local theory of transport, finding no significant evidence for global wave energy transport.

TI Energy quality, emergy, and transformity: H.T. Odum's contributions to
   quantifying and understanding systems
SO ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
AB We present in this article, a brief historical overview of the development of the concepts and theories of energy quality, and net energy that were the precursors to emergy. The concepts evolved over decades, beginning in the 1950s with Odum's work on tracing energy flows in ecosystems. During the 1970s, Odum's attention was drawn to larger scale systems that included the economies of humans and the concept of net energy. In the 1980s, Odum quantified energy quality and defined it as a "donor-based" evaluation technique. In the 1990s, energy quality was further refined and rigorous definitions for "emergy" and "transformity" were given. The units of emergy were defined as solar emjoules (abbreviated seJ) and the units of transformity were seJ/J. In addition, we provide some insights into the types of processes and systems that have been evaluated using emergy methods. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Atmospheric neutrinos: LMA oscillations, U-e3 induced interference and
   CP-violation
SO NUCLEAR PHYSICS B
AB We consider oscillations of the low energy (sub-GeV sample) atmospheric neutrinos in the three neutrino context. We present the semi-analytic study of the neutrino evolution and calculate characteristics of the e-like events (total number, energy spectra and zenith angle distributions) in the presence of oscillations. At low energies there are three different contributions to the number of events: the LMA contribution (from nu(e)-oscillations driven by the solar oscillation parameters), the U-e3-contribution proportional to s(13)(2), and the U-e3-induced interference of the two amplitudes driven by the solar oscillation parameters. The interference term is sensitive to the CP-violation phase. We describe in details properties of these contributions. We find that the LMA, the interference and U-e3 contributions can reach 5-6%, 2-3% and 1-2% correspondingly. An existence of the significant (> 3-5%) excess of the e-like events in the sub-GeV sample and the absence of the excess in the multi-GeV range testifies for deviation of the 2-3 mixing from maximum. We consider a possibility to measure the deviation as well as the CP-violation phase in future atmospheric neutrino studies. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Decay of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Existing limits on the nonradiative decay of one neutrino to another plus a massless particle (e.g., a singlet Majoron) are very weak. The best limits on the lifetime to mass ratio come from solar neutrino observations and are tau/mgreater than or similar to10(-4) s/eV for the relevant mass eigenstate(s). For lifetimes even several orders of magnitude longer, high-energy neutrinos from distant astrophysical sources would decay. This would strongly alter the flavor ratios from the phi(nu e):phi(nu mu):phi(nu tau)=1:1:1 expected from oscillations alone and should be readily visible in the near future in detectors such as IceCube.

TI The magnetic helicity budget of a CME-prolific active region
SO SOLAR PHYSICS
AB Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are thought to be the way by which the solar corona expels accumulated magnetic helicity which is injected into the corona via several methods. DeVore (2000) suggests that a significant quantity is injected by the action of differential rotation, however Demoulin et al. (2002b), based on the study of a simple bipolar active region, show that this may not be the case. This paper studies the magnetic helicity evolution in an active region (NOAA 8100) in which the main photospheric polarities rotate around each other during five Carrington rotations. As a result of this changing orientation of the bipole, the helicity injection by differential rotation is not a monotonic function of time. Instead, it experiences a maximum and even a change of sign. In this particular active region, both differential rotation and localized shearing motions are actually depleting the coronal helicity instead of building it. During this period of five solar rotations, a high number of CMEs (35 observed, 65 estimated) erupted from the active region and the helicity carried away has been calculated, assuming that each can be modeled by a twisted flux rope. It is found that the helicity injected by differential rotation (approximate to-7x10(42) Mx(2)) into the active region cannot provide the amount of helicity ejected via CMEs, which is a factor 5 to 46 larger and of the opposite sign. Instead, it is proposed that the ejected helicity is provided by the twist in the sub-photospheric part of the magnetic flux tube forming the active region.

AB The heart of oxygenic photosynthesis is photosystem II (PSII), a multisubunit protein complex that uses solar energy to drive the splitting of water and production of molecular oxygen, The effectiveness of the photochemical reaction center of PSII depends on the efficient transfer of excitation energy from the surrounding antenna chlorophylls. A kinetic model for PSII, based on the x-ray crystal structure coordinates of 37 antenna and reaction center pigment molecules, allows us to map the major energy transfer routes from the antenna chlorophylls to the reaction center chromophores. The model shows that energy transfer to the reaction center is slow compared with the rate of primary electron transport and depends on a few bridging chlorophyll molecules. This unexpected energetic isolation of the reaction center in PSII is similar to that found in the bacterial photosystem, conflicts with the established view of the photophysics of PSII, and may be a functional requirement for primary photochemistry in photosynthesis. In addition, the model predicts a value for the intrinsic photochemical rate constant that is 4 times that found in bacterial reaction centers.

TI Heteropoly acid-incorporated TiO2 colloids as novel photocatalytic
   systems resembling the photosynthetic reaction center
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B
AB TiO2 colloids are very useful photocatalytic systems, capable of converting solar energy to chemical or electrical energy and environmental cleaning. The key step in enhancing photocatalytic efficiency is improving photoinduced interfacial electron transfer like plant photosynthesis. It remains difficult to modify TiO2 particles as a real analogue of the photosynthetic reaction centers of green plants. We attempted to incorporate a photoreactive heteropoly acid (HPA) such as H3PW12O40 into TiO2 colloids in aqueous polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (0.1%) solution, and found that two light reactions appear to operate in a series. Upon illumination of the HPA/TiO2 system with near-UV light (300-375 nm), interfacial electron transfer takes place from the conduction band of TiO2 to the incorporated HPA, which is also excited to catalyze photoreduction of Methyl Orange. The extent of the photoinduced reduction of the HPA adsorbed on TiO2 particles depends on the concentration ratio of the HPA and TiO2 colloids, irradiation wavelength, and intensity of radiation. It is found that the interfacial electron-transfer mechanism of HPA/TiO2 is quite analogous to the "Z-scheme" mechanism for plant photosynthetic systems. The photoinduced charge-carrier generation at the heterojunction is very efficient, and the photoreduction of Methyl Orange has been observed to be synergistically enhanced upon illumination of the HPA-incorporated TiO2 with visible light as well as near-UV light.

TI A cluster of black holes at the Galactic center
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB If the stellar population of the bulge contains black holes formed in the final core collapse of ordinary stars with M greater than or similar to 30 M., then about 25,000 stellar mass black holes should have migrated by dynamical friction into the central parsec of the Milky Way, forming a black hole cluster around the central supermassive black hole. These black holes can be captured by the central black hole when they randomly reach a highly eccentric orbit due to relaxation, either by direct capture (when their Newtonian peribothron is less than 4 Schwarzschild radii) or after losing orbital energy through gravitational waves. The overall depletion timescale is similar to 30 Gyr, so most of the 25,000 black holes remain in the central cluster today. The presence of this black hole cluster would have several observable consequences. First, the low-mass, old stellar population should have been expelled from the region occupied by the black hole cluster as a result of relaxation, implying a core in the profile of solar-mass red giants with a radius of similar to2 pc (i.e., 1'). The observed central density cusp (which has a core radius of only a few arcseconds) should be composed primarily of young (less than or similar to1 Gyr) stars. Second, flares from stars being captured by supermassive black holes in other galaxies should be rarer than usually expected because the older stars will have been expelled from the central regions by the black hole clusters of those galaxies. Third, the young (less than or similar to2 Gyr) stars found at distances similar to3-10 pc from the Galactic center should be preferentially on highly eccentric orbits. Fourth, if future high-resolution K-band images reveal sources microlensed by the Milky Way's central black hole, then the cluster black holes could give rise to secondary ("planet-like") perturbations on the main event.

AB Ruthenium complexes of the type trans-[Ru(dcbpyH(2))(2)(Cl)(2)], trans-[Ru(dcbpyH(2))(2)(H2O)(2)] and trans-[Ru(dcbpyH(2))(2)(NCS)(2)] (dcbpyH(2) = 4,4'-dicarboxylic acid-2,2'-bipyridine) were synthesized and characterized by NMR, UV-vis absorption and emission spectroscopy. The proton NMR spectra of the trans isomers, in the aromatic region, show only three peaks corresponding to the two dcbpy ligands in which all the pyridine rings are trans to each other and magnetically equivalent. The C-13-NMR spectrum of the trans isomer is characterized by a relatively simple pattern of resonances from the four equivalent pyridine rings. The lowest energy metal-to-ligand charge-transfer transition maximum of the trans-[Ru(dcbpyH(2))(2)(Cl)(2)] complex is at 14500 cm(-1) in DMF solution and shows onset of weak and broad emission signals above 11100 cm(-1), This is a significantly larger red shift compared with any of the trans ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes reported to date. The absorption and emission maxima of the trans complexes are red shifted compared with the cis analogues, which is due to the CO2H contribution in the trans isomer that stabilizes the LUMO relative to the LUMO of the cis isomer. The enhanced red response of the trans complexes renders them as suitable dyes for dye-sensitized titanium dioxide mesoporous electrodes. The electronic spectra of cis- and trans-[Ru(dcbpyH(2))(2)(Cl)(2)] complexes were calculated by ZINDO/S and compared with the experimental data. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

TI On the snow line in dusty protoplanetary disks
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB C. Hayashi prescribed a "minimum-mass solar nebula," which contained just enough material to make the planets. This prescription, which has been widely used in constructing scenarios for planet formation, proposed that ice will condense when the temperature falls below 170 K (the "snow line"). In Hayashi's model, that occurred at 2.7 AU. It is usually assumed that the cores of the giant planets (e.g., Jupiter) form beyond the snow line. The snow line, in Hayashi's model, is where the temperature of a black body that absorbed direct sunlight and reradiated as much as it absorbed would be 170 K. Since Hayashi, there have been a series of more detailed models of the absorption by dust of the stellar radiation and of accretional heating, which alter the location of the snow line. We have attempted a "self-consistent" model of a T Tauri disk in the sense that we used dust properties and calculated surface temperatures that matched observed disks. We then calculated the midplane temperature for those disks, with no accretional heating or with small(less than or equal to 10(-8) M-circle dot yr(-1)) accretion rates. (Larger accretion rates can push the snow line out to beyond 4 AU but do not match the observed disks.) Our models bring the snow line in to the neighborhood of 1 AU-not far enough to explain the close planetary companions to other stars, but much closer than in recent starting lines for orbit migration scenarios.

TI Proper motion of the compact, nonthermal radio source in the Galactic
   center Sagittarius A*
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB Proper motions and radial velocities of luminous infrared stars in the Galactic center have provided strong evidence for a dark mass of 2.5 x 10(6) M circle dot in the central 0.05 pc of the Galaxy. The leading hypothesis for this mass is a black hole. High angular resolution measurements at radio wavelengths find a compact radio source, Sagittarius (Sgr) A*, that is either the faint glow from a small amount of material accreting onto the hole with low radiative efficiency or a miniature active galactic nucleus (AGN) core-jet system. This paper provides a full report on the first program that has measured the apparent proper motion of Sgr A* with respect to background extragalactic reference frame. Our current result is
   mu(l,*) =[-6.18 =/- 0.19] mas yr(-1)
   mu(b,*) = [-0.65 +/- 0.17] mas yr(-1)
   The observations were obtained with the NRAO Very Large Array at 4.9 GHz over 16 yr. The proper motion of Sgr A* provides an estimate of its mass based on equipartition of kinetic energy between the hole and the surrounding stars. The measured motion is largest in galactic longitude. This component of the motion is consistent with the secular parallax that results from the rotation of the solar system about the center, which is a global measure of the difference between Oort's constants (A-B), with no additional peculiar motion of Sgr A*. The current uncertainty in Oort's galactic rotation constants limits the use of this component of the proper motion for a mass inference. In latitude, we find a small, and weakly significant, peculiar motion of Sgr A*, -19 +/- 7 km s(-1) after correction for the motion of the solar system with respect to the local standard of rest. We consider sources of peculiar motion of Sgr A* ranging from unstable radio wave propagation through intervening turbulent plasma to the effects of asymmetric masses in the center. These fail to account for a significant peculiar motion. One can appeal to an m = 1 dynamical instability that numerical simulations have revealed. However, the measurement of a latitude peculiar proper motion of comparable magnitude and error but with opposite sign in the companion paper by Reid leads us to conclude at the present time that our errors may be underestimated and that the actual peculiar motion might therefore be closer to zero. Improvement of these measurements with further observations and resolving the differences between independent experiments will provide the accuracies of a few km s(-1) in both coordinates that will provide both a black hole mass estimate and a definitive determination of Oort's galactic rotation constants on a global Galactic scale.

TI Sun exposure and pterygium of the eye: A dose-response curve
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB PURPOSE: To present a quantitative analysis of pterygium and ocular sun exposure, a dose-response curve, and a discussion of the health-promotion implications of the findings,
   METHODS: A hospital-based, case-control study was conducted in Perth, Western Australia. Case subjects had surgical removal of a pterygrum; control subjects had an ear, nose, or throat procedure. A lifetime history of residence, sun exposure patterns, and use of hats, spectacles, and sunglasses was obtained at interview. Measures of potential sun exposure included latitude, daily sunshine hours, and daily global solar radiant energy. The most complex estimate of actual sun exposure was the daily ocular solar radiation dose, calculated from climatic data, time spent outdoors not under shade, and the use of hats and spectacles.
   RESULTS: There were strong positive associations between pterygium and measures of potential and actual sun exposure. Associations were as strong for whole-life measures as for those in any specific age range. Pterygium odds ratios increased with exposure level; the odds ratio was 4.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.6 to 10.9) for the highest quarter of the daily sun exposure.. The strongest associations were seen for the estimated daily ocular solar radiation dose, with an odds ratio of 6.8 (95% confidence interval, 2.6 to 19.1) for the highest quarter of exposure.
   CONCLUSIONS: Pterygium is strongly related to ocular sun exposure, with little evidence that exposure during any particular period of life is more important than in other periods; the implication for prevention of pterygium is that ocular protection is beneficial at all ages.

TI Cosmic rays - VII. Individual element spectra: prediction and data
SO ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
AB Based on the earlier papers in this series, we discuss here the errors in the prediction of the model, and compare with the error ranges in the spectra for individual elements. The predictions are spectra of E-2.75+/-0.04 for hydrogen, and E-2.67-0.02+/-0.02 for helium and heavier elements below the knee. For particle energies above 10 Z GeV the data give E-2.77+/-0.02 for hydrogen and E-2.64+/-0.02 for helium and similar values for all heavier elements combined, where Z is the charge of the nucleus considered. At the higher energy range considered here the secondary elements Li, Be, and B as well as the sub-Fe group have spectra consistent with source-related spallation, such as occurs when a supernova driven explosions runs into a shell around the wind of the predecessor star.

TI HIGH-RESOLUTION SIMULATIONS OF COMPRESSIBLE CONVECTION USING THE
   PIECEWISE-PARABOLIC METHOD
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES
AB We use two-dimensional simulations to study turbulent and fully compressible thermal convection in deep atmospheres. Density contrasts across these convective layers are typically around 50. The fluid model is that of an ideal gas with a constant thermal conductivity. The piecewise-parabolic method (PPM), with thermal conductivity added in, is used to solve the fluid equations of motion. No explicit viscosity is included, and the low numerical viscosity of PPM leads to a very low effective Prandtl number. The resulting flows are temporally and spatially chaotic. Some of the simulations possess sufficiently high spatial resolutions that eddies of widely ranging sizes are allowed to coexist in the same pressure scale heights. We study a variety of convective systems: we vary the mesh resolution, the initial state, the strength with which the convection is driven, and the thermal conductivity. All of our results are subject to the highly idealized model we have adopted. The main point of this study is to illustrate the effects of a wide range of spatial scales on the nature of compressible convection.
   We describe and characterize the numerical viscosity of PPM and relate this numerical viscosity to the rate of decay of eddies and power spectra of the convective flows. We analyze the statistics of eddies and find a universal eddy profile for our low Prandtl number convective flows. We perform a Fourier analysis of the convective velocities and determine timescales for dynamic relaxation, dependence of the flow with depth, and relations between mesh resolution and global convective flow. The velocity power spectra systematically steepen as the depth increases, so that velocity over long wavelengths increases with depth and relative velocities across small wavelengths decreases with depth. We examine dynamic and thermal relaxation processes, interaction of small and large scales, mechanisms that undermine the stability of smooth flows, global structure of high-resolution, low Prandtl number-convection, compressibility, and small-scale structures in convection. Supersonic flow is present in all of our models, even for the most weakly driven where the temperature gradient along the lower boundary exceeds the adiabatic value by 0.4%. Shocks are ubiquitous and are an important mechanism for damping the flow. Small and large eddies coexist in the largest scale heights. Large eddies occasionally span the depth of the layer, but there are no persistent convection cells. Small eddies exist at all depths independent of local scale height. The largest eddies are predominantly in the largest/lowest scale heights. The correlation lengths of velocity fields and energy fluxes tend to be longer for vertical displacements than for horizontal displacements. Over the span of resolutions tested here, correlation lengths systematically decrease with increasing mesh resolution.

TI EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS OF SILICON SOLAR-CELLS BY THE IMPURITY
   PHOTOVOLTAIC EFFECT
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB A theoretical investigation of the impurity photovoltaic (IPV) effect for improving silicon solar-cell efficiency is presented. The approach is better than previous analyses because of the improved treatment of generation and recombination via impurities, and because it includes the effects of optical competition and light trapping. The approach is applied to the nonmidgap, deep-level impurity indium as the IPV effect impurity incorporated into an idealized silicon solar cell. The analysis is based on experimentally determined parameters for indium. Improvements of cell current, subgap spectral response, and energy conversion efficiency are quantified. The analysis reveals the importance of light trapping and proper selection of indium and dopant concentrations. The impurity photovoltaic effect is predicted to improve solar-cell efficiency.

TI IMPACTS ON REGIONAL CLIMATE OF AMAZON DEFORESTATION
SO GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB A simulation of the climate response to Amazon deforestation has been carried out. Precipitation is decreased on the average by 25% or 1.4 mm/day, with ET and runoff both decreasing by 0.7 mm/day. Modifications of surface energy balance through change of albedo and roughness are complicated by cloud feedbacks. The initial decrease of the absorption of solar radiation by higher surface albedos is largely cancelled by a reduction in cloud cover, but consequent reduction in downward longwave has a substantial impact on surface energy balance. Smoke aerosols might have an effect comparable to deforestation during burning season.

TI SIMULATION OF THE LAST GLACIAL CYCLE BY A COUPLED, SECTORIALLY AVERAGED
   CLIMATE-ICE SHEET MODEL .1. THE CLIMATE MODEL
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
AB This paper describes a sectorially averaged seasonal model developed for simulating the long-term response of the climate system to the astronomical forcing. The model domain covers the northern hemisphere. The atmospheric dynamics is represented by an improved zonally averaged quasi-geostrophic model. It includes a new parameterization of the meridional transport of quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity and a parameterization of the Hadley sensible heat transport. The atmosphere interacts with the other components of the climate system (ocean, sea ice, and land surface covered or not by snow and ice) through vertical fluxes of momentum, heat and water vapor. The model explicity incorporates detailed radiative transfer, surface energy balances, and snow and sea ice budgets. The vertical profile of the upper ocean temperature is computed by an integral mixed-layer model which takes into account meridional convergence of heat. Sea ice is represented by a thermodynamic model including leads and a new parameterization for lateral accretion. This paper presents the model climate for present conditions and results of sensitivity experiments obtained by modifying some internal parameters or by deactivating certain parameterizations in the model. Simulation of the present climate shows that the model is able to reproduce the main characteristics of the general circulation and, in particular, the surface wind field. The seasonal cycles of oceanic mixed layer, sea ice, and snow cover are also well reproduced. Sensitivity experiments show the importance of the meridional sensible heat transport by the Hadley circulation in the tropics, the seasonal cycle of the oceanic mixed-layer depth and sea ice formation in latitude bands where the average water temperature is above the freezing point. In a forthcoming paper, this model will be coupled to an ice sheet model and applied to the simulation of the last glacial cycle in the northern hemisphere.

TI Swallow-Tail Substituted Liquid Crystalline Perylene Bisimides:
   Synthesis and Thermotropic Properties
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Tailor-made synthesis and structure-property relationship of several swallow-tail N-substituted perylene bisimide (PBI) dyes are presented. PBI derivatives were synthesized by two distinct synthetic approaches, the details being evaluated herein. All the PBIs carry either alkyl swallow-tail or oligoethyl-englycolether (OEG) swallow-tail moieties as N-substituents, and many of them are unsymmetrically substituted. We avoided substitution at bay positions of the perylene core to maintain the planarity and strong pi-pi interactions, which favor intermolecular order and charge carrier transport. The thermotropic behavior, which is strongly influenced by the nature of the substituents was investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), polarization optical microscopy (POM), and X-ray diffraction measurements (XRD). The introduction of OEG swallow-tail units facilitates thermotropic liquid crystalline behavior in most cases and the unsymmetrical substitution allowed the tuning of the mesophase-width. The mesophases exhibit characteristic columnar hexagonal (COI(h)) packing arising from pi-pi. interactions between cofacially orientated perylene molecules. Thus, the inherent tendency of PBI molecules for crystallization could be effectively suppressed by incorporating flexible OEG swallow-tail units only at imide positions. This molecular design was crucial to obtain liquid crystallinity and intracolumnar long-range order. The substituents did not influence the electronic energy levels such as HOMO and LUMO.

TI Bifacial dye-sensitized solar cells based on an ionic liquid electrolyte
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Solar energy is a promising solution to global energy-related problems because it is clean, inexhaustible and readily available. However, the deployment of conventional photovoltaic cells based on silicon is still limited by cost, so alternative, more cost-effective approaches are sought. Here we report a bifacial dye-sensitized solar cell structure that provides high photo-energy conversion efficiency (similar to 6%) for incident light striking its front or rear surfaces. The design comprises a highly stable ruthenium dye ( Z907Na) in combination with an ionic-liquid electrolyte and a porous TiO(2) layer. The inclusion of a SiO(2) layer between the electrodes to prevent generation of unwanted back current and optimization of the thickness of the TiO(2) layer are responsible for the enhanced performance.

TI The Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II Supernova Survey: Search algorithm and
   follow-up observations
SO ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL
AB The Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II Supernova Survey has identified a large number of new transient sources in a 300 deg(2) region along the celestial equator during its first two seasons of a three-season campaign. Multi-band (ugriz) light curves were measured for most of the sources, which include solar system objects, galactic variable stars, active galactic nuclei, supernovae (SNe), and other astronomical transients. The imaging survey is augmented by an extensive spectroscopic follow-up program to identify SNe, measure their redshifts, and study the physical conditions of the explosions and their environment through spectroscopic diagnostics. During the survey, light curves are rapidly evaluated to provide an initial photometric type of the SNe, and a selected sample of sources are targeted for spectroscopic observations. In the first two seasons, 476 sources were selected for spectroscopic observations, of which 403 were identified as SNe. For the type la SNe, the main driver for the survey, our photometric typing and targeting efficiency is 90%. Only 6% of the photometric SN la candidates were spectroscopically classified as non-SN la instead, and the remaining 4% resulted in low signal-to-noise, unclassified spectra. This paper describes the search algorithm and the software, and the real-time processing of the SDSS imaging data. We also present the details of the supernova candidate selection procedures and strategies for follow-up spectroscopic and imaging observations of the discovered sources.

TI Anchoring ZnO particles on functionalized single wall carbon nanotubes.
   Excited state interactions and charge collection
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB A conducting scaffold of carbon nanotube architecture has been used to anchor ZnO nanoparticles. The interaction between functionalized carbon nanotubes (f-CNT) and photoexcited ZnO nanoparticles results in direct electron transfer between the two systems. The role of f-CNT in facilitating the charge collection and charge transport in the f-CNT-ZnO composite film is elucidated by photoelectrochemical measurements.

TI Titanium dioxide for solar-hydrogen I. Functional properties
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
CT International Conference on Materials for Hydrogen Energy
CY AUG   27, 2004
CL Sydney, AUSTRALIA
HO Univ New S Wales
AB The present work considers the concept of photoelectrochemical generation of hydrogen through water splitting using solar energy (solar-hydrogen). The focus is on functional material properties that are essential for the performance of photoelectrochemical cell for solar-hydrogen. The performance of the cell is discussed in terms of the energy conversion efficiency (ECE). It is argued that TiO2 and TiO2-based materials are the most promising candidates for photoelectrodes for solar-hydrogen. The modification of TiO2 in order to achieve desired performance parameters is discussed in terms of the electronic structure, concentration of charge carriers and segregation-induced surface properties, which are critical to the ECE. Challenges to the development of a bi-photoelectrode cell, equipped with both n-type and p-type TiO2, forming photoanode and photocathode, respectively, are discussed. The research strategies and pressing issues related to the optimization of key functional properties necessary for the commercialization of solar-hydrogen are outlined. It is shown that defect chemistry is the most appropriate framework for tailoring the functional properties of TiO2-based oxide systems in order to obtain high-performance photoelectrodes. The present work provides an overview of the research progress on solar-hydrogen. (c) 2006 International Association for Hydrogen Energy. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Influence of surface area on charge transport and recombination in
   dye-sensitized TiO2 solar cells
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B
AB The dependence of the electron transport and recombination dynamics on the internal surface area of mesoporous nanocrystalline TiO2 films in dye-sensitized solar cells was investigated. The internal surface area was varied by altering the average particle size in the films. The scaling of the photoelectron density and the electron diffusion coefficient at short circuit with internal surface area confirms the results of a recent study (Kopidakis, N.; Neale, N. R.; Zhu, K.; van de Lagemaat, J.; Frank, A. J. Appl. Phys. Lett. 2005, 87, 202106) that transport-limiting traps are located predominately on the surfaces of the particles. The recombination current density was found to increase superlinearly (with an exponent of 1.40 +/- 0.12) with the internal surface area. This result is at odds with the expected linear dependence of the recombination current density on the surface area when only the film thickness is increased. The observed scaling of the recombination current density with surface area is consistent with recombination being transport-limited. Evidence is also presented confirming that photoinjected electrons recombine with redox species in the electrolyte via surface states rather than from the TiO2 conduction band.

TI Steps toward the hydrogen economy
SO ENERGY
CT International Workshop on Advances in Energy Studies
CY MAY, 2000
CL Porto Venere, ITALY
AB The hydrogen economy is defined as the industrial system in which one of the universal energy carriers is hydrogen (the other is electricity) and hydrogen is oxidized to water that may be reused by applying an external energy source for dissociation of water into its component elements hydrogen and oxygen. There are three different primary energy-supply system classes which may be used to implement the hydrogen economy, namely, fossil fuels (coal, petroleum, natural gas, and as yet largely unused supplies such as shale oil, oil from tar sands, natural gas from geo-pressured locations, etc.), nuclear reactors including fission reactors and breeders or fusion nuclear reactors over the very long term, and renewable energy sources (including hydroelectric power systems, wind-energy systems, ocean thermal energy conversion systems, geothermal resources, and a host of direct solar energy-conversion systems including biomass production, photovoltaic energy conversion, solar thermal systems, etc.). Examination of present costs of hydrogen production by any of these means shows that the hydrogen economy favored by people searching for a non-polluting gaseous or liquid energy carrier will not be developed without new discoveries or innovations. Hydrogen may become an important market entry in a world with most of the electricity generated in nuclear fission or breeder reactors when high-temperature waste heat is used to dissociate water in chemical cycles or new inventions and innovations lead to low-cost hydrogen production by applying as yet uneconomical renewable solar techniques that are suitable for large-scale production such as direct water photolysis with suitably tailored band gaps on semiconductors or low-cost electricity supplies generated on ocean-based platforms using temperature differences in the tropical seas.

AB Bathocuproine (BCP) or tris(acetylacetonato)ruthenium(in) (Ru(acaC)(3)) is used as the exciton-blocking layer (EBL) in photovoltaic cells. The difference in thickness-dependent efficiency characteristics between the blockers (see Figure) is that the Ru(acac)3 energy-level alignment allows for the transport of holes from the cathode to the C-60 acceptor level, whereas BCP relies on metal-deposition-induced damage for charge transport.

TI The 13RC - Bringing together the most advanced radiative transfer tools
   for cloudy atmospheres
SO BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
AB The interaction of clouds with solar and terrestrial radiation is one of the most important topics of climate research. In recent years it has been recognized that only a full three-dimensional (3D) treatment of this interaction can provide answers to many climate and remote sensing problems, leading to the worldwide development of numerous 3D radiative transfer (RT) codes. The international Intercomparison of 3D Radiation Codes (I3RC), described in this paper, sprung from the natural need to compare the performance of these 3D RT codes used in a variety of current scientific work in the atmospheric sciences. I3RC supports intercomparison and development of both exact and approximate 3D methods in its effort to 1) understand and document the errors/limits of 3D algorithms and their sources; 2) provide "baseline" cases for future code development for 3D radiation; 3) promote sharing and production of 3D radiative tools; 4) derive guidelines for 3D radiative tool selection; and 5) improve atmospheric science education in 3D RT. Results from the two completed phases of I3RC have been presented in two workshops and are expected to guide improvements in both remote sensing and radiative energy budget calculations in cloudy atmospheres.

TI Transonic hydrodynamic escape of hydrogen from extrasolar planetary
   atmospheres
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB Hydrodynamic escape is an important process in the formation and evolution of planetary atmospheres. Transonic steady state solutions of the time-independent hydrodynamic equations are difficult to find because of the existence of a singularity point. A numerical model is developed to study the hydrodynamic escape of neutral gas from planetary atmospheres by solving the time-dependent hydrodynamic equations. The model is validated against an analytical solution of the escape from an isothermal atmosphere. The model uses a two-dimensional energy deposition calculation instead of the single-layer heating assumption, which is not sufficiently accurate for hydrodynamic escape from a hydrogen-rich planetary atmosphere. When applied to the atmospheres of extrasolar planets, the model results are in good agreement with observations of the transiting extrasolar planet HD 209458b. The model predicts that hydrogen is escaping from HD 209458b at a maximum rate of 6 x 10(10) g s(-1). The extrasolar planet is stable under the hydrodynamic escape of hydrogen. The rate of hydrogen hydrodynamic escape from other possible extrasolar planets is investigated using the model. The importance of hydrogen hydrodynamic escape for the long-term evolution of extrasolar planets is discussed. Simulation shows that through hydrodynamic escape of hydrogen, a planet at the orbit of Mercury (0.4 AU) and with 0.5 Uranus mass can lose about 10% of its mass within 850 million yr if the solar EUV radiation is 10 times the present level. This calculation provides an indication of how Mercury may have evolved during the early days of the solar system.

TI Design of DSC panel with efficiency more than 6%
SO SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS
AB Dye sensitized solar cells (DSCs), as a new innovative technology, were developed very quickly in the past decade since Prof. M. Gratzel (EPFL) made the breakthrough in 1991 (Nature 353 (1991) 737). While photoelectric conversion efficiency of 11.04% was achieved last year in EPFL (J. Photocem. Photobiol. A: Chem. 164 (2004) 3), 8.2% was achieved with a size of 2.36 cm(2) in 2001 by the ECN group (Sol. Energy Mater. Sol. Cells 84 (2004) 125), which is a very exciting result for large scale DSCs. As potential low cost solar cells, DSC module and the panel's efficiency and stability are still critical problems to the way of marketing. We show our research in the test and design of modules and panels in the past few years at our institute. We have achieved photoelectric conversion efficiency around 6% with 15 x 20 cm(2) module, and our future primary 500 W DSC power station with the same performance 40 x 60 cm(2) panel is under way.

TI Promise and problems of emergy analysis
SO ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
AB Solar Emergy is the available solar energy used up directly and indirectly to make a service or product. Although this basic concept is quite straightforward, its implications are potentially profound. H.T. Odum pioneered the development and use of emergy, and presented it as a way of understanding the behavior of self-organized systems, valuing ecological goods and services, and jointly analyzing ecological and economic systems. Unfortunately, like many groundbreaking ideas, emergy has encountered a lot of resistance and criticism, particularly from economists, physicists, and engineers. Some critics have focused on detailed practical aspects of the approach, while others have taken issue with specific parts of the theory and claims. This paper discusses the main features and criticisms of emergy and provides insight into the relationship between emergy and concepts from engineering thermodynamics, such as exergy and cumulative exergy consumption. This reveals the close link between emergy and ecological cumulative exergy consumption, and indicates that most of the criticisms of emergy are either common to all holistic approaches that account for ecosystems and other macrosystems within their systems boundaries, or a result of misunderstandings derived from a lack of communication between various disciplines, or are not relevant for engineering applications. By identifying the main points of criticisms of emergy, this paper attempts to clarify many of the common misconceptions about emergy, inform the community of emergy practitioners about the aspects that need to be communicated better or improved, and suggest solutions. Further research and interaction with other disciplines is essential to bring one of H.T. Odum's finest contributions into the mainstream to guide humanity on "the prosperous way down."

TI Factors influencing stream temperatures in small streams: substrate
   effects and a shading experiment
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
AB The temperature of stream water is an important control of many in-stream processes. To better understand the processes and consequences of solar energy inputs to streams, stream temperature dynamics were examined before, during, and after experimental shading of a 150-m reach of a second-order stream in the Oregon Cascade Range. Maximum water temperatures declined significantly in the shaded reach, but minimum and mean temperatures were not modified. Heat budget calculations before shading show the dominance of solar energy as an influence of stream temperature. The influence of substrate type on stream temperature was examined separately where the water flowed first over bedrock and then through alluvial substrates. Maximum temperatures in the upstream bedrock reach were up to 8.6degreesC higher and 3.4 degreesC lower than downstream in the alluvial reach. Better understanding of factors that influence not only maximum but minimum temperatures as well as diurnal temperature variation will highlight types of reaches in which stream temperature would be most responsive to changes in shading. Many apparent discrepancies in stream temperature literature can be explained by considering variation in the relative importance of different stream temperature drivers within and among streams and over time.

TI Atmospheric escape from hot Jupiters
SO ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
AB The extra-solar planet HD 209458b has been found to have an extended atmosphere of escaping atomic hydrogen (Vidal-Madjar et al. 2003), suggesting that "hot Jupiters" closer to their parent stars could evaporate. Here we estimate the atmospheric escape (so called evaporation rate) from hot Jupiters and their corresponding life time against evaporation. The 14 calculated evaporation rate of HD 209458b is in excellent agreement with the H I Lyman-alpha observations. We find that the tidal forces and high temperatures in the upper atmosphere must be taken into account to obtain reliable estimate of the atmospheric escape. Because of the tidal forces, we show that there is a new escape mechanism at intermediate temperatures at which the exobase reaches the Roche lobe. From an energy balance, we can estimate plausible values for the planetary exospheric temperatures, and thus obtain typical life times of planets as a function of their mass and orbital distance.

TI High sensitivity search for (nu)over-bar(e)'s from the Sun and other
   sources at KamLAND
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Data corresponding to a KamLAND detector exposure of 0.28 kton yr has been used to search for (v) over bar (e)'s in the energy range 8.3<E-(v) over bare<14.8 MeV. No candidates were found for an expected background of 1.1+/-0.4 events. This result can be used to obtain a limit on (v) over bar (e) fluxes of any origin. Assuming that all (v) over bar (e) flux has its origin in the Sun and has the characteristic B-8 solar nu(e) energy spectrum, we obtain an upper limit of 3.7x10(2) cm(-2) s(-1) (90% C.L.) on the (v) over bar (e) flux. We interpret this limit, corresponding to 2.8x10(-4) of the standard solar model B-8 nu(e) flux, in the framework of spin-flavor precession and neutrino decay models.

TI Photoprotective strategies of overwintering evergreens
SO BIOSCIENCE
AB High levels of solar radiation (direct and reflected off snow) can be absorbed by green leaves in the winter. However, the energy that is absorbed by these leaves often cannot be used through photosynthesis under winter conditions. Most colored objects would simply bleach if faced with the same conditions, because light-absorbing pigments pass energy onto oxygen, forming reactive oxygen species that destroy the pigments. Two key means by which overwintering leaves prevent reactive oxygen-mediated damage have been identified. One, used by all leaves in the winter, involves the employment of xanthophyll carotenoids in a photoprotective process whereby the light energy absorbed by chlorophyll is converted to heat and dissipated harmlessly. The other, found in some evergreen species but not in overwintering annual or biennial mesophytes, involves the degradation of proteins responsible for generating high-energy electrons, thereby suppressing transfer of these electrons to oxygen.

TI Study of an aqueous lithium chloride desiccant system: Air
   dehumidification and desiccant regeneration
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB Desiccant systems have been proposed as energy saving alternatives to vapor compression air conditioning for handling the latent load. Use of liquid desiccants offers several design and performance advantages over solid desiccants, especially when solar energy is used for regeneration. For liquid-gas contact, packed towers with low pressure drop provide good heat and mass transfer characteristics for compact designs. This paper presents the results from a study of the performance of a packed tower absorber and regenerator for an aqueous lithium chloride desiccant dehumidification system. The rates of dehumidification and regeneration, as well as the effectiveness of the dehumidification and regeneration processes were assessed under the effects of variables such as air and desiccant flow rates, air temperature and humidity, and desiccant temperature and concentration. A variation of the Oberg and Goswami mathematical model was used to predict the experimental findings giving satisfactory results. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

We find that the total cross section is indeed converging for neutrino energies up to 20 MeV, and thus our calculations can provide constraints on theoretical uncertainties for the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory. We stress the importance of a direct experimental measurement to high precision in at least one channel, in order to fix an axial two-body counrerterm.

TI Grassland desertification by grazing and the resulting
   micrometeorological changes in Inner Mongolia
SO AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB Overgrazing is one of the most primary causes of desertification in semi-arid zones of China. From 1992 to 1994 we conducted a grazing experiment in Naiman (lat. 42 degrees 58'N, long. 120 degrees 43'E, 345 m asl), Inner Mongolia, China to elucidate desertification mechanisms. Our experimental field, which was covered with some short grasses, legumes and forbs, included four plots where grazing sheep numbers differed (0, 3, 6, or 9 individuals). Micrometeorological measurement data were analyzed using the Bowen ratio energy balance method. Ground surface reflectivity (albedo) increased with grazing intensity. The overgrazed plot had been desertified after 3 year's grazing experiment. Albedo can be regarded as an important indicator of potential grassland desertification. When desertification occurs, then albedo will exceed a critical value. Partitioning of net radiation exhibited distinct patterns among the four plots as a result of the interplay between albedo and in situ vegetation. Ratios of the net radiation or net available radiation to solar radiation tended to decrease with increasing grazing intensity. Bur this pattern of changes was largely affected by soil moisture regime and vegetation status during the measurements. Grazing also remarkably affected wind regimes over the grazing experimental plots through altering surface roughness. Especially, sustained overgrazing decreased surface roughness length so substantially that wind could act directly on sandy grassland surface to initiate desertification. A permissible grazing capacity of the studied temperate semi-arid grassland was also proposed for future grassland management. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Comparison of various titania samples of industrial origin in the solar
   photocatalytic detoxification of water containing 4-chlorophenol
SO CATALYSIS TODAY
AB The degradation of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) was used as a model reaction to investigate the photocatalytic properties of different industrial TiO(2) catalysts and to compare their efficiencies in the treatment of contaminated waters. Parallel experiments have been performed using either artificial UV-light in a batch photoreactor in laboratory experiments or solar energy in the flow reactor of the pilot plant at Plataforma Solar de Almeria (PSA) in Spain. Depending on the kinetic criteria chosen for comparison ((i) initial rate of pollutant disappearance; (ii) amounts of intermediate products present in solution at a given time; (iii) time necessary to obtain total mineralization), different classifications of photocatalyst activities were observed. Among various physical characteristics such as particle size, structure or active site density, which may intervene on the photocatalytic activity, the influence of the surface area appeared of prime importance. For lower surface area catalysts, there is a decrease in the readsorption rate of intermediate products and consequently in the overall photodegradation rate. By contrast, for higher surface area catalysts, it was observed a lower final rate of total organic carbon (TOC) disappearance because of a very low coverage in pollutant which favors electron-hole recombination.
   The comparison of the kinetic results for decontaminating water at PSA and in laboratory experiments indicated the same kinetic order (apparent first order) for 4-CP disappearance and the same apparent quantum yield. However, fewer intermediate products and a faster TOC disappearance were observed in the solar pilot reactor at PSA, which, in addition, worked with a smaller optimum concentration of suspended titania. This was ascribed to the design of the photoreactor. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Spatial and temporal invariance in the spectra of energetic particles in
   gradual solar events
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB We show evidence of spatial and temporal invariance in the energy spectra of similar to 1-100 MeV protons from large gradual solar energetic particle (SEP) events. Nearly identical spectra are seen over longitude intervals of up to 160 degrees, and the intensities at all energies decline with e-folding time constants of 6-18 hr for periods of similar to 3 days. The region of the invariant spectra is associated with acceleration on the eastern flank of the shock wave driven out from the Sun by a coronal-mass ejection (CME). The quasi-parallel shock in this region changes only slowly with time, and a quasi equilibrium is established for particles stored on field lines in the expanding volume between the shock and the Sun. On the western flank of the shock, the SEP event is more dynamic. Here, the nearly quasi-perpendicular shock produces harder spectra that change more rapidly with time as regions of the shock with varying speed and angle sweep across the observer's field line.
   Gradual SEP events arise from large CMEs with sufficient speeds to generate shocks that are fast enough to accelerate particles. In our study, shocks with transit speed >750 km s(-1) always accelerate particles, while those with speeds of 500-750 km s(-1) sometimes do. However, invariant spectra seem to occur in all gradual SEP events as a consequence of the structure and topology of the CME and shock.

TI CATASTROPHIC EVOLUTION OF A FORCE-FREE FLUX ROPE - A MODEL FOR ERUPTIVE
   FLARES
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB We present a self-consistent, two-dimensional, magnetohydrodynamic model of an eruptive flare based on an ideal-MHD coronal magnetic field configuration which is line-tied at the photosphere and contains a force-free flux rope. If the flux rope is not too large, the gradual disappearance of the photospheric field causes the flux rope to lose equilibrium catastrophically and jump to a higher altitude, releasing magnetic energy in the process. During the jump, an extended current sheet forms below the flux rope, and subsequent reconnection of this current sheet allows the flux rope to escape into the outer corona. A critical flux-rope radius, which depends on the form of the photospheric field, divides configurations which undergo a catastrophic loss of equilibrium from those which do not. For a photospheric field equivalent to that produced by a submerged, two-dimensional magnetic quadrupole, the critical radius is 0.23 times the length scale of the photospheric field. This result shows that catastrophic eruptions can occur for flux ropes having plausible solar values. We identify the catastrophic loss of equilibrium with the impulsive phase of eruptive flares and the subsequent reconnection of the current sheet with the gradual phase.

TI A new, lower value of total solar irradiance: Evidence and climate
   significance
SO GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB The most accurate value of total solar irradiance during the 2008 solar minimum period is 1360.8 +/- 0.5 W m(-2) according to measurements from the Total Irradiance Monitor (TIM) on NASA's Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) and a series of new radiometric laboratory tests. This value is significantly lower than the canonical value of 1365.4 +/- 1.3 W m(-2) established in the 1990s, which energy balance calculations and climate models currently use. Scattered light is a primary cause of the higher irradiance values measured by the earlier generation of solar radiometers in which the precision aperture defining the measured solar beam is located behind a larger, view-limiting aperture. In the TIM, the opposite order of these apertures precludes this spurious signal by limiting the light entering the instrument. We assess the accuracy and stability of irradiance measurements made since 1978 and the implications of instrument uncertainties and instabilities for climate research in comparison with the new TIM data. TIM's lower solar irradiance value is not a change in the Sun's output, whose variations it detects with stability comparable or superior to prior measurements; instead, its significance is in advancing the capability of monitoring solar irradiance variations on climate-relevant time scales and in improving estimates of Earth energy balance, which the Sun initiates.

TI Wastewater treatment high rate algal ponds for biofuel production
SO BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB While research and development of algal biofuels are currently receiving much interest and funding, they are still not commercially viable at today's fossil fuel prices. However, a niche opportunity may exist where algae are grown as a by-product of high rate algal ponds (HRAPs) operated for wastewater treatment. In addition to significantly better economics, algal biofuel production from wastewater treatment HRAPs has a much smaller environmental footprint compared to commercial algal production HRAPs which consume freshwater and fertilisers. In this paper the critical parameters that limit algal cultivation, production and harvest are reviewed and practical options that may enhance the net harvestable algal production from wastewater treatment HRAPs including CO(2) addition, species control, control of grazers and parasites and bioflocculation are discussed.

TI Comparative Photoactivity and Antibacterial Properties of C-60
   Fullerenes and Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by aqueous suspensions of fullerenes and nano-TiO2 (Degussa P25) was measured both in ultrapure water and in minimal Davis (MD) microbial growth medium. Fullerol (hydroxylated C-60) produced singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) in ultrapure water and both O-1(2) and superoxide (O-2(-center dot)) in MD medium, but no hydroxyl radicals (OH center dot) were detected in either case. PVP/C-60 (C-60 encapsulated with poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone)) was more efficient than fullerol in generating singlet oxygen and superoxide. However,two other aggregates Of C-60, namely THF/nC(60) (prepared with tetrahydofuran as transitional solvent) and aqu/nC(60) (prepared by vigorous stirring Of C-60 powder in water), were not photoactive. Nano-TiO2(also present as aggregates) primarily produced hydroxyl radicals in pure water and superoxide in MD medium. Bacterial (Escherichia coli) toxicity tests suggest that, unlike nano-TiO2 which was exclusively phototoxic, the antibacterial activity of fullerene suspensions was linked to ROS production.. Nano-TiO2 may be more efficient for water treatment involving UV or solar energy, to enhance contaminant oxidation and perhaps for disinfection. However, fullerol and PVP/C-60 may be useful as water treatment agents targeting specific pollutants or microorganisms that are more sensitive to either superoxide or singlet oxygen.

TI Comparative day/night metatranscriptomic analysis of microbial
   communities in the North Pacific subtropical gyre
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB Metatranscriptomic analyses of microbial assemblages (< 5 mu m) from surface water at the Hawaiian Ocean Time-Series (HOT) revealed community-wide metabolic activities and day/night patterns of differential gene expression. Pyrosequencing produced 75 558 putative mRNA reads from a day transcriptome and 75 946 from a night transcriptome. Taxonomic binning of annotated mRNAs indicated that Cyanobacteria contributed a greater percentage of the transcripts (54% of annotated sequences) than expected based on abundance (35% of cell counts and 21% 16S rRNA of libraries), and may represent the most actively transcribing cells in this surface ocean community in both the day and night. Major heterotrophic taxa contributing to the community transcriptome included alpha-Proteobacteria (19% of annotated sequences, most of which were SAR11-related) and gamma-Proteobacteria (4%). The composition of transcript pools was consistent with models of prokaryotic gene expression, including operon-based transcription patterns and an abundance of genes predicted to be highly expressed. Metabolic activities that are shared by many microbial taxa (e.g. glycolysis, citric acid cycle, amino acid biosynthesis and transcription and translation machinery) were well represented among the community transcripts. There was an overabundance of transcripts for photosynthesis, C1 metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation in the day compared with night, and evidence that energy acquisition is coordinated with solar radiation levels for both autotrophic and heterotrophic microbes. In contrast, housekeeping activities such as amino acid biosynthesis, membrane synthesis and repair, and vitamin biosynthesis were overrepresented in the night transcriptome. Direct sequencing of these environmental transcripts has provided detailed information on metabolic and biogeochemical responses of a microbial community to solar forcing.

TI Mesoporous nitrogen-doped TiO2 for the photocatalytic destruction of the
   cyanobacterial toxin Microcystin-LR under visible light irradiation
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB The presence of the harmful cyanobacterial toxins in water resources worldwide drives the development of an innovative and practical water treatment technology with great urgency. This study deals with two important aspects: the fabrication of mesoporous nitrogen-doped TiO2 (N-TiO2) photocatalysts and their environmental application for the destruction of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) under visible light. In a nanotechnological sol-gel synthesis method, a nitrogen-containing surfactant (dodecylammonium chloride) was introduced as a pore templating material for tailor-designing the structural properties of TiO2 and as a nitrogen dopant for its visible light response. The resulting N-TiO2 exhibited significantly enhanced structural properties including 2-8 nm mesoporous structure (porosity 44%) and high surface area of 150 m(2)/g. Red shift in light absorbance up to 468 nm, 0.9 eV lower binding energy of electrons in Ti 2p state, and reduced interplanar distance of crystal lattices proved nitrogen doping in the TiO2 lattice. Due to its narrow band gap at 2.65 eV, N-TiO2 efficiently degraded MC-LR under visible spectrum above 420 nm. Acidic condition (pH 3.5) was more favorable for the adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of MC-LR on N-TiO2 due to electrostatic attraction forces between negatively charged MC-LR and +6.5 mV charged N-TiO2. Even under UV light, MC-LR was decomposed 3-4 times faster using N-TiO2 than control TiO2. The degradation pathways and reaction intermediates of MC-LR were not directly related to the energy source for TiO2 activation (UV and visible) and nature of TiO2 (neat and nitrogen-doped). This study implies a strong possibility for the in situ photocatalytic remediation of contaminated water with cyanobacterial toxins and other toxic compounds using solar light, a sustainable source of energy.

SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB A simple technique was developed to fabricate a large-area TiO2 electrode layer using electrospun nanorods for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Using this technique, we assembled DSSCs of area similar to 1 cm(2) consisting of a thin TiO2 nanoparticle layer and a thick TiO2 nanorod layer as electrode. The TiO2 nanorods were obtained by mechanically grinding electrospun TiO2 nanofibers. A titania sol was first spin-coated on a conductive glass plate and a TiO2 nanorod layer was next spray dried on it to fabricate TiO2 nanoparticle/ nanorod layers. These layers were subsequently sintered. The best- performing DSSC evaluated under AM1.5G (1 sun) condition gave current density similar to 13.6 mA cm (-2), open circuit voltage similar to 0.8 V, fill factor similar to 51% and energy conversion efficiency similar to 5.8%.

TI Influence of pi-conjugation units in organic dyes for dye-sensitized
   solar cells
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Two organic dyes with the general structure donor-conjugated chain-acceptor (D-pi-A) have been investigated as sensitizers for nanocrystalline TiO2 solar cells. The electron donor and acceptor groups were pyrrolidine and cyano acrylic acid, respectively. The conjugated chain of 2-cyano-3-{5-[2-(4-pyrrolidin-1-ylphenyl)vinyl]thiophen-2-yl}acrylic acid contains one phenyl ring and a thiophene unit and is therefore denoted PT, while for 2-cyano-3-{5 -[2-(5-pyrrolidin-1-ylthiophen-2-yl)vinyl]thiophen-2-yl}acrylic acid the phenyl ring is replaced by a second thiophene unit (TT). Solar-to-electrical energy conversion efficiencies under simulated AM 1.5 irradiation (1000 W m(-2)) of 2.3% were obtained for solar cells based on PT but of less than 0.05% for those based on TT. The reasons for the dramatic difference of the efficiencies were analyzed. Photoinduced absorption measurements revealed that the TT dye was not properly regenerated by redox electrolyte after electron injection. This sluggish regeneration is probably due to the 0.3 V less positive HOMO level for TT dye compared to the PT dye, resulting in a lower driving force for regeneration of the oxidized dye by iodide in the electrolyte. In addition, regeneration of the oxidized TT dye and electron injection from the excited TT dye may be poor due to formation of dye aggregates/complexes, as FT-IR measurements show an excess of not properly and/or unidentate bound TT dye molecules instead of bidentate bound PT dye molecules. The results highlight that small structural change of dyes results in significant changes in redox energies and binding features, affecting dramatically the performance of these dyes in dye-sensitized solar cells.

TI Martian atmospheric erosion rates
SO SCIENCE
AB Mars was once wet but is now dry, and the fate of its ancient carbon dioxide atmosphere is one of the biggest puzzles in martian planetology. We have measured the current loss rate due to the solar wind interaction for different species: Q(O+) = 1.6 . 10(23) per second = 4 grams per second ( g s(-1)), Q(O-2(+)) = 1.5 . 10(23) s(-1) = 8 g s(-1), and Q(CO2+) = 8 . 10(22) s(-1) = 6 g s(-1) in the energy range of 30 to 30,000 electron volts per charge. These rates can be propagated backward over a period of 3.5 billion years, resulting in the total removal of 0.2 to 4 millibar of carbon dioxide and a few centimeters of water. The escape rate is low, and thus one has to continue searching for water reservoirs and carbon dioxide stores on or beneath the planetary surface and investigate other escape channels.

TI A novel optimization sizing model for hybrid solar-wind power generation
   system
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB This paper develops the Hybrid Solar-Wind System Optimization Sizing (HSWSO) model, to optimize the capacity sizes of different components of hybrid solar-wind power generation systems employing a battery bank. The HSWSO model consists of three parts: the model of the hybrid system, the model of Loss of Power Supply Probability (LPSP) and the model of the Levelised Cost of Energy (LCE). The flow chart of the HSWSO model is also illustrated. With the incorporated HSWSO model, the sizing optimization of hybrid solar-wind power generation systems can be achieved technically and economically according to the system reliability requirements. A case study is reported to show the importance of the HSWSO model for sizing the capacities of wind turbines, PV panel and battery banks of a hybrid solar-wind renewable energy system.

TI Singlet fission for dye-sensitized solar cells: Can a suitable
   sensitizer be found?
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB We discuss possible improvements in the efficiency of dye-sensitized photovoltaic cells using dyes capable of singlet fission into two triplets, thus producing two electron-hole pairs from a single photon. It is pointed out that, in addition to derivatives of large alternant hydrocarbons, those of biradicals are also likely candidates for a favorable ordering of excited-state energy levels, E(T-2), E(S-1) > 2E(T-1). A large number of potentially favorable structures has been examined by the semiempirical Pariser-Parr-Pople method and some also by the time-dependent density functional theory method. Several likely candidates have been identified for experimental examination.

AB The efficiency of electric power generation by dye-sensitized mesoscopic photovoltaic cells has been progressing steadily over the last years reaching now 11% in full sunlight. An important question for practical applications concerns the stability of these devices under prolonged exposure to light or heat. Strikingly stable operation can be obtained by judicious selection of the sensitizer, electrolyte and sealant rendering feasible a service life of at least 20 years under normal outdoor conditions. The sensitizer playing a central role in the light energy conversion process, we analyze the kinetic requirements for it to sustain the required one hundred million turnovers. We also review recent results on the use of self-assembled monolayers of amphiphilic sensitizers and co-adsorbents to enhance the thermal robustness of the device.

TI Hot Jupiters and hot spots: The short- and long-term chromospheric
   activity on stars with giant planets
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB We monitored the chromospheric activity in the Ca II H and K lines of 13 solar-type stars ( including the Sun): 8 of them over 3 years at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) and 5 in a single run at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). A total of 10 of the 13 targets have close planetary companions. All of the stars observed at the CFHT show long-term (months to years) changes in H and K intensity levels. Four stars display short-term (days) cyclical activity. For two, HD 73256 and k(1) Cet, the activity is likely associated with an active region rotating with the star; however, the flaring in excess of the rotational modulation may be associated with a hot Jupiter. A planetary companion remains a possibility for k(1) Cet. For the other two, HD 179949 and v And, the cyclic variation is synchronized to the hot Jupiter's orbit. For both stars this synchronicity with the orbit is clearly seen in two out of three epochs. The effect is only marginal in the third epoch at which the seasonal level of chromospheric activity had changed for both stars. Short-term chromospheric activity appears weakly dependent on the mean K line reversal intensities for the sample of 13 stars. In addition, a suggestive correlation exists between this activity and the M-p sin i of the star's hot Jupiter. Because of their small separation (<= 0.1 AU), many of the hot Jupiters lie within the Alfven radius of their host stars, which allows a direct magnetic interaction with the stellar surface. We discuss the conditions under which a planet's magnetic field might induce activity on the stellar surface and why no such effect was seen for the prime candidate, tau Boo. This work opens up the possibility of characterizing planet-star interactions, with implications for extrasolar planet magnetic fields and the energy contribution to stellar atmospheres.

TI Mechanism of charge recombination in dye-sensitized nanocrystalline
   semiconductors: Random flight model
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B
AB The trap-filling effect on the kinetics of charge recombination in dye-sensitized TiO2 nanoparticles is discussed on the basis of the random flight model. The model assumes that electrons move between trap sites on the surface of a nanoparticle by diffusion in the conduction band. After an electron is thermally detrapped into the conduction band, it can subsequently be captured by any empty trap or recombine with a cation within the same nanoparticle. This is an alternative to the nearest-neighbor random walk. A reasonable agreement with recent experimental data is observed. It is concluded, in accord with the previous studies, that the reaction is governed by the energy redistribution of trapped electrons rather than by spatial diffusion.

TI A supernova-regulated interstellar medium: Simulations of the turbulent
   multiphase medium
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB The dynamic state of the interstellar medium, heated and stirred by supernovae (SNe), is simulated using a three-dimensional, nonideal MHD model in a domain extended 0.5 x 0.5 kpc horizontally and 2 kpc vertically, with the gravitational field symmetric about the midplane of the domain, z = 0. We include both Type I and Type II SNe, allowing the latter to cluster in regions with enhanced gas density. The system segregates into two main phases: a warm, denser phase and a hot, dilute gas in global pressure equilibrium; there is also dense, cool gas compressed into filaments, shells, and clumps by expanding SN remnants. The filling factor of the hot phase grows with height, so it dominates at \z\ greater than or similar to 0.5 kpc. The multicomponent structure persists throughout the simulation, and its statistical parameters show little time variation. The warm gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium, which is supported by thermal and turbulent pressures. The multiphase gas is in a state of developed turbulence. The rms random velocity is different in the warm and hot phases, 10 and 40 km s(-1), respectively, at \z\ less than or similar to 1 kpc; the turbulent cell size (twice the velocity correlation scale) is about 60 pc in the warm phase.

TI Wind spacecraft observations of solar impulsive electron events
   associated with solar type III radio bursts
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB We present Wind spacecraft observations of solar impulsive electron events associated with locally generated Langmuir waves during solar type III radio bursts. The solar impulsive electrons had energies from similar to 600 eV to greater than 300 keV. Local Langmuir emissions associated with these fluxes generally coincided with the arrival of 2-12 keV electrons. A survey of 27 events over 1 yr shows that there were few occurrences of electron distributions (similar to 96 s averaged) that were unstable to Langmuir waves and none that had a substantial growth rate (>3 x 10(-2) s(-1)) or endured for more than 96 s. Intense solar impulsive electron events that occurred on 1995 April 2 are studied in detail. Marginally stable (plateaued) distributions occasionally coincided with a periods of local Langmuir emissions, but the electron distributions were otherwise stable. These observations suggest that kinetic processes were modifying the electron distribution but also suggest that processes other than one-dimensional quasilinear relaxation were involved. We find that solar impulsive electron distributions were often unstable to oblique waves, such as quasi-electrostatic whistler waves or electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves, suggesting that competition between Langmuir and oblique emissions may be important. There are several other features in the Wind spacecraft solar impulsive electron observations that are noteworthy. Nondispersive flux modulations were visible in many of the events (also visible in the published;ISEE 3 data) in similar to 1-4 keV electrons, suggesting that a local hydromagnetic instability may have accompanied the lowest energy solar impulsive electron fluxes. The Wind data differ from the ISEE 3 data in the energy spectra of the electron events. ISEE 3 recorded few events with only high-energy (>10 keV) electron fluxes, whereas a survey of the Wind events shows a substantially higher ratio of high-energy events. The high-energy events were often associated with solar flares that could not have been magnetically well connected with the satellite.

TI Dynamics of magnetic loops in the coronae of accretion disks
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB Axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations are used to study the evolution of general magnetic field configurations where a magnetic field B threads different radii of a differentially rotating accretion disk. The differential rotation of the footpoints of B held loops at different radii on the disk surface causes a twisting of the coronal magnetic field, an increase in the coronal magnetic energy, and an opening of the loops in the region where the magnetic pressure is larger than the matter pressure (beta less than or similar to 1). In the region where beta greater than or similar to 1, the loops may be only partially opened. Current layers form in the narrow regions that separate oppositely directed magnetic field lines. Reconnection occurs in these layers as a result of the small numerical magnetic diffusivity of the code. In contrast with the case of the solar coronal magnetic field, the combination of magnetic and centrifugal forces leads to significant matter outflow from the disk. The faster rotation of the inner part of the disk gives a stronger outflow from this part of the disk. The outflow accelerates with increasing distance from the disk up to velocities in excess of the escape speed. The outflows show some collimation within the computational region and have a large power output mainly in the form of a Poynting flux. Thus these outflows are pertinent to the origin of astrophysical jets. We present results of a survey of simulation runs for the behavior of magnetic loops and outflows for a wide range of held strengths B and mass outflow sates (M) over dot(j). The model and processes observed are relevant to the coronae of accretion disks around stellar-mass objects, including pre-main-sequence stars, compact stars, and black holes, as well as the coronae of disks around massive black holes in active galactic nuclei. Opening of magnetic field loops may lead to transient and/or steady outflows, while reconnection events may be responsible for X-ray flares in such objects.

SO SPACE SCIENCE REVIEWS
CT ISSI Workshop on Cosmic Rays in the Heliosphere
CY MAR 10-14, 1997
CL BERN, SWITZERLAND
AB Almost all theoretical and numerical models for the modulation of cosmic ray in the heliosphere are based on Parker's transport equation which contains all the important basic physical processes. The relative importance of the various mechanisms is however not established and may vary significantly over 22 years. The simultaneous measurements of solar wind parameters, heliospheric magnetic field properties and cosmic rays over a wide range of energies and positions in the heliosphere have brought the realization that modulation is much more complicated than what the original drift models predicted.
   In the process the sophistication of models based on solving Parker's equation has increased by orders of magnitude. A short review of the global modulation of cosmic rays is given from a theoretical and modelling point of view.

SO CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Internal reflection spectroscopy has been used to obtain the in situ infrared spectra of ruthenium(II) bipyridyl dicarboxylic acid photosensitiser species adsorbed to Degussa P25 and sol-gel TiO2 films from dilute aqueous solutions. The spectra indicate that adsorption is via the carboxylate groups which bridge surface titanium ions. Adsorption isotherms and binding constants have been derived from the spectral data. The ruthenium(II) cis-di(thiocyanato)-N,N'-bis(2,2'-bipyridyl-4,4'-dicarboxylic acid) complex, which is an efficient sensitiser, has the highest binding constant. This suggests a link between the strength of surface binding and the solar energy conversion efficiency.

TI 2.5-45 mu m SWS spectroscopy of the Circinus galaxy
SO ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
AB We present 2.5-45 mu m ISO SWS spectra of the Circinus galaxy which is one of the closest spirals containing both a visually obscured Seyfert nucleus and circumnuclear starburst activity. In addition to PAH features, H-2 and low excitation ionic lines ([FeII], [NeII], [SIII]) from the starburst region its spectrum shows several prominent lines from highly ionized species ([NeIII,V,VI], [SIV], [MgV,VII,VIII], [OIV], [SiIX]) which arise in gas photoionized by the AGN within its ionization cone. Adopting solar abundances and a density of 5000 cm-3 derived from the [NeV]14.3/24.3 mu m ratio we have developed a model which can reproduce the absolute fluxes of most of the visible/near infrared and ISO lines from species with ionization energies in the range 50 - 320 eV to within a factor similar to 2. Most of the discrepancies can probably be attributed to uncertainties in the calibration, abundances and atomic parameters. Of particular interest for further work are [OIV] 26 mu m and [SIV] 10.5 mu m which are observed to be a factor similar to 2 brighter and fainter respectively than expected. The best fit ionizing spectrum is characterized by a v(-0.5) X-ray continuum - consistent with recent ASCA satellite observations - plus a pronounced UV bump which peaks at similar or equal to 70eV (180 Angstrom) in a plot of vF(v) versus v and is responsible for most of the ISO lines. Models in which the UV bump is represented by a broken power law, typical of a thin accretion disc, or a quasi black body at 2 x 10(5)K give equally good fits to the observed emission line spectrum. Whatever its origin it appears that re-processed ionizing radiation from the AGN probably dominates over the starburst contribution to the total infrared luminosity.

TI Cosmic ray decreases: 1964-1994
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
AB We have studied 30 years (1964-1994) of neutron monitor data in order to understand the principle mechanisms causing short-term (< 20-day duration) cosmic ray decreases seen at Earth. By examining the characteristics of associated low energy (<200 MeV) particle enhancements in combination with the neutron monitor data, we have determined the responsible solar wind disturbances for 153 of the 180 greater than or equal to 4% decreases. The vast majority (86% of the 153 events) are caused by coronal mass ejections and the shocks that they generate. The ejecta is intercepted only when the solar event originates within 50 degrees of the Sun's central meridian. For more distant events, only the shock is intercepted at Earth. We present a fist of all 180 events seen in the years 1964-1994 together with the associated solar event, when this can be determined, and some details about the solar wind structures based on in situ solar wind data, if available. This list represents a compendium of major solar wind disturbances affecting a large section of the inner heliosphere over this time period. We also discuss enhanced daily variations in some events which are related to radial gradients caused by strong disturbances inside the Earth's orbit.

TI Evidence for large-scale solar magnetic reconnection from radio and
   X-ray measurements
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB Utilizing Yohkoh Soft X-ray Telescope and Nancay radioheliograph data, we present, for the first time, observations of expanding twisted X-ray loops and a series of nonthermal radio bursts that follow the loop expansion in time and space up to similar to 12' distance. The loops were produced during a long-duration C4.7 flare close to disk center on 1994 October 25 at 1049 UT. The series of radio bursts were observed on the southern hemisphere above a weak positive-polarity region. The Kitt Peak magnetogram shows the existence of a weak negative-polarity region on the northern hemisphere at the same heliolongitude. Simultaneously with the nonthermal radio bursts, we observed the appearance of two remote X-ray brightenings and subsequent formation of two coronal holes above these weak (quiet) magnetic regions of opposite polarity, which strongly suggest the involvement of these remote regions in the event. During the 6 hr-long gradual phase of the flare, new X-ray loop connections developed among the active region and the remote quiet regions. A nonthermal radio continuum emission originating from the active region was also observed.
   We propose that the series of radio bursts, two remote X-ray brightenings, and new coronal loop connections were all signatures of a large-scale reconnection process between the expanding twisted flare loops and overlying transequatorial loops connecting quiet-Sun regions. The reconnection was only partial; the external part of the overlying large-scale fields were pushed out in the solar wind by the expanding twisted loops, leading to the formation of the coronal holes. The interaction between the active region and the large-scale fields seemed to be active during the entire gradual phase of the flare. This scenario may also explain the measurement of high-energy electrons in the interplanetary medium from 74 degrees south heliolatitude as observed by Ulysses.

TI Two-component auroral electrojet: Importance for substorm studies
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
AB This paper attempts to synthesize the diverse number of observations of electric fields and currents in the high-latitude ionosphere during substorms. By demonstrating that there are often spatial shifts among regions of high ionospheric conductivity, large electric fields and intense currents in the auroral electrojet, it is shown that substorm time variations of the current patterns over the entire polar region consist of two basic components. The first is related to the two-cell convection pattern and the second to the westward electrojet in the dark sector, which is in turn related to the three-dimensional wedge current system. These two components result from the relative strength of electric fields and conductivities in the intensification of the auroral electrojet and are identified as the signatures for directly driven and the unloading components in solar wind-magnetosphere interactions. We contend that disturbed intervals do not necessitate the presence of substorm expansion-phase activity and that the vast number of earlier complex results concerning the auroral electrojet carl be ascertained from the high degree of variability of the two components, depending on substorm events, substorm phases, and their own spatial/temporal scale sizes. It is demonstrated that several major issues that have remained controversial are now accounted for reasonably well in terms of this two-component electrojet model. We also predict specific features of the substorm auroral electrojet that have not yet been observed.

SO PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
AB We derived the temperature distributions along the 16 steady loops observed with the Yohkoh Soft X-ray Telescope. We have found that the temperature and emission measure (pressure) are the highest around the loop top, and decrease towards the footpoints. Some of the loops have a plateau in the temperature distribution at around the loop top (''trapezoidal'' temperature distribution). The other loops, on the other hand, have a sharp peak in the temperature distributions (''triangular'' temperature distribution). This triangular temperature distribution suggests that the energy input is concentrated at the peak. We have estimated the thermal conductive fluxes downward to the footpoints from the gradients of the temperature distributions. The flux ranges from 1 x 10(7) to 2 x 10(8) [erg s(-1) cm(-2)]. We derived the total energy loss L(T), which is the sum of the conductive and radiative losses: L(T) = 2 x 10(7)-3 x 10(8) [erg s(-1) cm(-2)]. We discovered a good correlation between the total energy loss and the gas pressure p(g) for the steady loops: L(T) = 1.2 x 10(7) p(g)(0.99+/-0.12). The correlation is consistent with the theoretical energy scaling law for the steady loops: L(T) = 4.0-5.1 x 10(3) .(p(g) . T-m(1/2)), where T-m is the maximum temperature (T-m similar to 6 x 10(6) [K] for all the loops analyzed here).

TI BIOTECHNOLOGY OF ALGAL BIOMASS PRODUCTION - A REVIEW OF SYSTEMS FOR
   OUTDOOR MASS-CULTURE
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYCOLOGY
AB Microalgae are very efficient solar energy converters and they can produce a great variety of metabolites. Man has always tried to take advantage of these properties through algal mass culture. Despite the fact that many applications for microalgae have been described in the literature, these microorganisms are still of minor economic importance. Industrial reactors for algal culture are at present, all designed as open race-ways (shallow open ponds where culture is circulated by a paddle-wheel). Technical and biological limitations of these open systems have given rise to the development of enclosed photoreactors (made of transparent tubes, sleeves or containers and where light source may be natural or artificial). The present review surveys advances in these two technologies for cultivation of microalgae. Starting from published results, the advantages and disadvantages of open systems and closed photobioreactors are discussed. A few open systems are presented for which particularly reliable results are available. Emphasis is then put on closed systems, which have been considered as capital intensive and are justified only when a fine chemical is to be produced.

TI OPTIMUM APERTURE SIZE AND OPERATING TEMPERATURE OF A SOLAR
   CAVITY-RECEIVER
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB For solar cavity-receivers operating at high temperatures; the optimum aperture size results from a compromise between maximizing radiation capture and minimizing radiation losses. When the absorbed solar energy is utilized as high temperature process heat, the energy conversion efficiency can be represented as the product of the energy absorption efficiency and the Carnot efficiency. We describe a simple, semiempirical method to determine the optimum aperture size and optimum operating temperature of a solar cavity-receiver for which its energy conversion efficiency is maximum. Such optimization strongly depends on the incident solar flux distribution at the aperture plane of the receiver. We analytically examine the case of a Gaussian distribution of the incident power flux, and we compare theoretical results with the results obtained when using an optically measured flux distribution. Using Monte-Carlo ray tracing, we further investigate the influence of sunshape on the optimal parameters of a cavity-receiver in a paraboloidal concentrator.

TI DISTRIBUTED SNOWMELT SIMULATIONS IN AN ALPINE CATCHMENT .1. MODEL
   EVALUATION ON THE BASIS OF SNOW COVER PATTERNS
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
AB This paper presents an attempt at deterministically modeling spatially distributed snowmelt in an alpine catchment.  The basin is 9.4 km2 in area and elevations range from 1900 to 3050 m above sea level.  The model makes use of digital terrain data with 25 m grid spacing.  Energy balance components are calculated for each grid element taking topographic variations of solar radiation into account.  For each grid element albedo and snow surface temperatures are simulated.  Model performance is evaluated on the basis of snow cover depletion patterns as derived from weekly air photographs.  The use of spatially distributed data allows for addressing individual model components.  Results indicate that the basic model assumptions are realistic.  Model inadequacies are shown to arise from processes not included in the model such as avalanching and long wave emission from surrounding terrain as well as inaccurate model parameters.

TI MAGNETOMETER AND RADAR OBSERVATIONS OF MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC CAVITY MODES
   IN THE EARTHS MAGNETOSPHERE
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Night and early morning data from the Johns Hopkins University, Applied Physics Laboratory HF radar at Goose Bay and from the magnetometers in the Canadian CANOPUS array often show structured spectra with distinct spectral peaks at 1.3, 1.9, and 2.6 mHz.  These frequencies are very stable and vary by less than +/- 5% for the 6 days of data we have analysed.  The radar measurements of the F-region drift velocities indicate that these spectral peaks are often associated with field line resonances of the shear Alfven wave, and that the resonances are seen at lower latitudes as the frequency increases.  The magnetometer data indicate that the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves have westward phase velocities.  We shall show that these observations are compatible with the formation of MHD cavity modes in the early morning and nightside magnetosphere, between the magnetopause, at approximately 14.5 R(E), and turning points in the dipolar magnetosphere, outside the plasmasphere.  Likely sources of energy are compressional pulses from the solar wind or Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities in the low-latitude boundary layer.

TI CdS Quantum Dots-Sensitized TiO2 Nanorod Array on Transparent Conductive
   Glass Photoelectrodes
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB An oriented single-crystalline TiO2 nanorod or wire array on transparent conductive substrates would be the most desirable nanostructure in preparing photoelectrochemical solar cells because of its efficient charge separation and transport properties as well as superior light harvesting efficiency. In this study, a TiO2 nanorod array film grown directly on transparent conductive glass (Fro) was prepared by a simple hydrothermal method. The formation of CdS quantum dots (QDs) on the vertically aligned TiO2 nanorods photoelectrode was carried out by chemical bath deposition. The as-prepared materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM, and X-ray diffraction. The results indicate that CdS QDs with a diameter smaller than 10 nm are uniformly covered on the surface of the single-crystalline TiO2 nanorods. Under AM 1.5 G illumination, the photoelectrode was found with a photocurrent intensity of 5.778 mA/cm(2) at a potential of 0 V versus Ag/AgCl and an open-circuit photovoltage of 1.292 V versus Ag/AgCl. The photocurrent is 28.6 times higher than that of a bare TiO2 nanorod array, and the photoelectrochemical properties are comparable to those of a CdS QDs-sensitized TiO2 nanotube array, suggesting that the CdS QDs-sensitized TiO2 nanorod array on MO photoelectrodes has a potential application in solar cells.

TI String axiverse
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB String theory suggests the simultaneous presence of many ultralight axions, possibly populating each decade of mass down to the Hubble scale 10(-33) eV. Conversely the presence of such a plenitude of axions (an axiverse) would be evidence for string theory, since it arises due to the topological complexity of the extra-dimensional manifold and is ad hoc in a theory with just the four familiar dimensions. We investigate how several upcoming astrophysical experiments will be observationally exploring the possible existence of such axions over a vast mass range from 10(-33) eV to 10(-10) eV. Axions with masses between 10(-33) eV to 10(-28) eV can cause a rotation of the cosmic microwave background polarization that is constant throughout the sky. The predicted rotation angle is independent of the scale of inflation and the axion decay constant, and is of order alpha similar to 1/137 -within reach of the just launched Planck satellite. Axions in the mass range 10(-28) eV to 10(-18) eV give rise to multiple steps in the matter power spectrum, providing us with a snapshot of the axiverse that will be probed by galaxy surveys-such as BOSS, and 21 cm line tomography. Axions in the mass range 10(-22) eV to 10(-10) eV can affect the dynamics and gravitational wave emission of rapidly rotating astrophysical black holes through the Penrose superradiance process. When the axion Compton wavelength is of order of the black hole size, the axions develop superradiant atomic bound states around the black hole nucleus. Their occupation number grows exponentially by extracting rotational energy and angular momentum from the ergosphere, culminating in a rotating Bose-Einstein axion condensate emitting gravitational waves. For black holes lighter than similar to 10(7) solar masses accretion cannot replenish the spin of the black hole, creating mass gaps in the spectrum of rapidly rotating black holes that diagnose the presence of destabilizing axions. In particular, the highly rotating black hole in the X-ray binary LMC X-1 implies an upper limit on the decay constant of the QCD axion f(a) <= 2 X 10(17) GeV, much below the Planck mass. This reach can be improved down to the grand unification scale f(a) less than or similar to 2 X 10(16) GeV, by observing smaller stellar mass black holes.

TI A Weak Donor-Strong Acceptor Strategy to Design Ideal Polymers for
   Organic Solar Cells
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Polymers to be used in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells should maintain a low highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level as well as a narrow band gap in order to maximize the open circuit voltage (V(oc)) and the short circuit current (J(sc)). To concurrently lower the HOMO energy level and the band gap, we propose to modify the donor acceptor low band gap polymer strategy by constructing alternating copolymers incorporating a "weak donor" and a "strong acceptor". As a result, the "weak donor" should help maintain a low HOMO energy level while the "strong acceptor" should reduce the band gap via internal charge transfer (ICT). This concept was examined by constructing a library of polymers employing the naphtho[2,1-b:3,4-b]dithiophene (NDT) unit, as the weak donor, and benzothiadiazole (BT) as the strong acceptor. PNDT-BT, designed under the "weak donor strong acceptor." strategy, demonstrated both a low HOMO energy level of -5.35 eV and a narrow band gap of 1.59 eV. As expected, a noticeably high V(oc) of 0.83 V was obtained from the BHJ device of PNDT-BT blended with PCBM. However, the J(sc) (similar to 3 mA/cm(2)) was significantly lower, than the maximum expected current from such a low band gap material, which limited the observed efficiency to 1.27% (with a 70 nm thin film). Further improvements in the efficiency are expected from these materials if new strategies can be identified to (a) increase the molecular weight and (b) improve the hole mobility while still maintaining a low HOMO energy level and a narrow band gap.

TI THE FORMATION MECHANISM OF GAS GIANTS ON WIDE ORBITS
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB The recent discoveries of massive planets on ultra-wide orbits of HR 8799 and Fomalhaut present a new challenge for planet formation theorists. Our goal is to figure out which of three giant planet formation mechanisms core accretion (with or without migration), scattering from the inner disk, or gravitational instability-could be responsible for Fomalhaut b, HR 8799 b, c and d, and similar planets discovered in the future. This paper presents the results of numerical experiments comparing the long-period planet formation efficiency of each possible mechanism in model A star, G star, and M star disks. First, a simple core accretion simulation shows that planet cores forming beyond 35 AU cannot reach critical mass, even under the most favorable conditions one can construct. Second, a set of N-body simulations demonstrates that planet-planet scattering does not create stable, wide-orbit systems such as HR 8799. Finally, a linear stability analysis verifies previous work showing that global spiral instabilities naturally arise in high-mass disks. We conclude that massive gas giants on stable orbits with semimajor axes a greater than or similar to 35 AU form by gravitational instability in the disk. We recommend that observers examine the planet detection rate as a function of stellar age, controlling for the planets' dimming with time. Any age trend would indicate that planets on wide orbits are transient relics of scattering from the inner disk. If planet detection rate is found to be independent of stellar age, it would confirm our prediction that gravitational instability is the dominant mode of producing detectable planets on wide orbits. We also predict that the occurrence ratio of long-period to short-period gas giants should be highest for M dwarfs due to the inefficiency of core accretion and the expected small fragment mass (similar to 10 M(Jup)) in their disks.

TI Photocatalytic construction and building materials: From fundamentals to
   applications
SO BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
AB Heterogeneous photocatalysis has been intensively studied in recent decades because it only requires photonic energy to activate the chemical conversion contrasting with conventional catalysis which needs heat for thermo-activation. Over the years, the theories for photochemical activity of photocatalyst including photo-induced redox reaction and super-hydrophilic conversion of TiO2 itself have been established. The progress in academic research significantly promotes its practical applications, including the field of photocatalytic construction and building materials. TiO2 modified building materials are most popular because TiO2 has been traditionally used as a white pigment. The major applications of TiO2 based photocatalytic building materials include environmental pollution remediation, self-cleaning and self-disinfecting. The advantage of using solar light and rainwater as driving force has opened a new domain for environmentally friendly building materials. In this paper, the basic reaction mechanisms on photocatalyst surface under the irradiation of ultraviolet and their corresponding applications in building and construction materials are reviewed. The problems faced in practical applications and the trends for future development are also discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Photoresponse in the visible range from Cr doped TiO2 nanotubes
SO CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Layers of TiO2 nanotubes have been fabricated by electrochemical anodization of Ti. After annealing the tubes to an anatase structure Cr doping was carried out by ion implantation at an energy of 60 keV and at two nominal fluences, 5 x 10(15) cm(-2) and 5 x 10(16) cm(-2).
   XRD measurements reveal that the anatase structure shows a certain degree of 'amorphization' after ion implantation. However, this effect can be reversed by subsequent thermal annealing.
   Photoelectrochemical measurements show a visible photoresponse for the Cr+ implanted tubes. Reannealing the tubes, leads to an increase in the photoresponse magnitude in the visible range of the solar spectrum. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Geographical gradients of species richness: a test of the water-energy
   conjecture of Hawkins et al. (2003) using European data for five taxa
SO GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB Aim We present an analysis of grid-based species-richness data for European plants, mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles, designed to test the proposition of Hawkins et al. (2003a) that the single best factor describing richness variation switches from the water regime to the energy regime in the mid-latitudes and that the 'breakpoint' is related to the physiological character of the taxa. We go on to develop subregional models showing the extent to which regional model fits vary as a function of the extent of the study system, and compare the relative performance of 'water', 'energy' and 'water-energy' models of richness for southern, northern and pan-European models.
   Location Western Europe.
   Methods We use atlas data comprising species range data for 187 species of mammals, 445 species of breeding birds, 58 amphibians, 91 reptiles and 2362 plant species, inserted into a c. 50 x 50 km grid cell system. We used 11 modelled climate variables, averaged for the period 1961-90. Statistical analyses were carried out using generalized additive models (GAMs), with splines simplified to a maximum of four degrees of freedom, and we tested for spatial autocorrelation using Moran's I values obtained at 10 different distance intervals. We selected favoured models on the grounds of deviance explained combined with a simple parsimony criterion, such that we selected either: (1) the best two-variable energy, water or water-energy model, or (2) a four-variable water-energy model, where the latter improved on the best two-variable model by a minimum of 5% deviance explained.
   Results Threshold energy values, at which richness shows a transition from an increasing to a decreasing function of annual solar radiation, were identified for all taxa apart from reptiles. We found conditional support for the switch from dominance of water variables (southern models) to energy variables (northern models). Our favoured models switched between 'water' and 'energy' for mammals, and between 'energy' and 'water-energy' for birds, depending on whether we used data of pan-European extent, southern or northern subsets. Deviance explained in our favoured models varied from 15% (birds, southern Europe) to 72% (amphibians, northern Europe), i.e. ranging from very poor to good fits with the data. Comparison with previous work indicates that our models are generally consistent with (if sometimes weaker than) previous findings.
   Main Conclusions Our models are incomplete representations of factors influencing macro-scale richness patterns across Europe, taking no explicit account of, for example, topographic variation, human influences or long-term climatic variation. However, with the exception of birds, for which only the northern model attains over one-third deviance explained, the models show that climate can account for meaningful proportions of the deviance. We find general support for considering water and energy regimes together in modelling species richness, and for the proposition that water is more limiting in southern Europe and energy in the north. Our analyses demonstrate the sensitivity of model outcomes to the geographical location and extent of the study system, illustrating that simple curve-fitting exercises like these, particularly if based on regions with the complex history and geography characteristic of Europe, are unlikely to provide the basis for global, predictive models. However, such exercises may be of value in detecting which aspects of water and energy regimes may be of most importance in refining independently generated global models for regional application.

TI Pre-feasibility study of stand-alone hybrid energy systems for

SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB A potential solution for stand-alone power generation is to use a hybrid energy system in parallel with some hydrogen energy storage. In this paper, a pre-feasibility study of using hybrid energy systems with hydrogen as an energy carrier for applications in Newfoundland. Canada is explained. Various renewable and non-renewable energy sources, energy storage methods and their applicability in terms of cost and performance are discussed. HOMER is used as a sizing and optimization tool. Sensitivity analysis with wind speed data. solar radiation level. diesel price and fuel cell cost was done. A remote house having an energy consumption of 25 kW h/d with a 4.73 kW peak power demand was considered as the stand-alone load. It was found that. a wind-diesel-battery hybrid system is the most suitable solution at present. However. with a reduction of fuel cell cost to 15% of its current value, a wind-fuel cell system would become a superior choice. Validity of such projection and economics against conventional power sources were identified. Sizing, performance and various cost indices were also analyzed in this paper. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

TI A comparison of recent reanalysis datasets using objective feature
   tracking: Storm tracks and tropical easterly waves
SO MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
AB Data from four recent reanalysis projects [ECMWF, NCEP-NCAR, NCEP - Department of Energy ( DOE), NASA] have been diagnosed at the scale of synoptic weather systems using an objective feature tracking method. The tracking statistics indicate that, overall, the reanalyses correspond very well in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) lower troposphere, although differences for the spatial distribution of mean intensities show that the ECMWF reanalysis is systematically stronger in the main storm track regions but weaker around major orographic features. A direct comparison of the track ensembles indicates a number of systems with a broad range of intensities that compare well among the reanalyses. In addition, a number of small-scale weak systems are found that have no correspondence among the reanalyses or that only correspond upon relaxing the matching criteria, indicating possible differences in location and/or temporal coherence. These are distributed throughout the storm tracks, particularly in the regions known for small-scale activity, such as secondary development regions and the Mediterranean.
   For the Southern Hemisphere (SH), agreement is found to be generally less consistent in the lower troposphere with significant differences in both track density and mean intensity. The systems that correspond between the various reanalyses are considerably reduced and those that do not match span a broad range of storm intensities. Relaxing the matching criteria indicates that there is a larger degree of uncertainty in both the location of systems and their intensities compared with the NH. At upper-tropospheric levels, significant differences in the level of activity occur between the ECMWF reanalysis and the other reanalyses in both the NH and SH winters. This occurs due to a lack of coherence in the apparent propagation of the systems in ERA15 and appears most acute above 500 hPa. This is probably due to the use of optimal interpolation data assimilation in ERA15. Also shown are results based on using the same techniques to diagnose the tropical easterly wave activity. Results indicate that the wave activity is sensitive not only to the resolution and assimilation methods used but also to the model formulation.

TI A method to determine the heating mechanisms of the solar corona
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB One of the paradigms about coronal heating has been the belief that the mean or summit temperature of a coronal loop is completely insensitive to the nature of the heating mechanisms. However, we point out that the temperature profile along a coronal loop is highly sensitive to the form of the heating. For example, when a steady state heating is balanced by thermal conduction, a uniform heating function makes the heat flux a linear function of distance along the loop, while T(7/2) increases quadratically from the coronal footpoints; when the heating is concentrated near the coronal base, the heat flux is small and the T(7/2) profile is flat above the base; when the heat is focused near the summit of a loop, the heat flux is constant and T(7/2) is a linear function of distance below the summit. It is therefore important to determine how the heat deposition from particular heating mechanisms varies spatially within coronal structures such as loops or arcades and to compare it to high-quality measurements of the temperature profiles.
   We propose a new two-part approach to try and solve the coronal heating problem, namely, first of all to use observed temperature profiles to deduce the form of the heating, and second to use that heating form to deduce the likely heating mechanism. In particular, we apply this philosophy to a preliminary analysis of Yohkoh observations of the large-scale solar corona. This gives strong evidence against heating concentrated near the loop base for such loops and suggests that heating uniformly distributed along the loop is slightly more likely than heating concentrated at the summit. The implication is that large-scale loops are heated in situ throughout their length, rather than being a steady response to low-lying heating near their feet or at their summits. Unless waves can be shown to produce a heating close enough to uniform, the evidence is therefore at present for these large loops more in favor of turbulent reconnection at many small randomly distributed current sheets, which is likely to be able to do so. In addition, we suggest that the decline in coronal intensity by a factor of 100 from solar maximum to solar minimum is a natural consequence of the observed ratio of magnetic field strength in active regions and the quiet Sun; the altitude of the maximum temperature in coronal holes may represent the dissipation height of Alfven waves by turbulent phase mixing; and the difference in maximum temperature in closed and open regimes may be understood in terms of the roles of the conductive flux there.

TI On the conversion of blast wave energy into radiation in active galactic
   nuclei and gamma-ray bursts
SO ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
AB It has been suggested that relativistic blast waves may power the jets of AGN and gamma-ray bursts (GRB). We address the important issue how the kinetic energy of collimated blast waves is converted into radiation. It is shown that swept-up ambient matter is quickly isotropised in the blast wave frame by a relativistic two-stream instability, which provides relativistic particles in the jet without invoking any acceleration process. The fate of the blast wave and the spectral evolution of the emission of the energetic particles is therefore solely determined by the initial conditions. We compare our model with existing multiwavelength data of AGN and find remarkable agreement.

TI A new estimate of the local interstellar energy density and ionization
   rate of galactic cosmic rays
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB Using data from the Voyager and Pioneer spacecraft at distances up to 60 AU from the Sun to help define the effects of solar modulation, we have made a new estimate of the local interstellar cosmic-ray spectra and the associated energy density and ionization rate. The energy density, including the low-energy electron contribution, is similar to 1.80 eV cm(-3), equivalent energetically to that in a 7 mu G magnetic field. The ionization rate from this same cosmic-ray population, including a significant contribution from low-energy electrons, is (3-4) x 10(-17) s(-1) (H atom). This is most likely a minimum value and is not too different from estimates of the typical ionization rate required to heat the interstellar medium and maintain the diffuse ionized gas range from (3-30) x 10(-17) s(-1) (H atom) as a function of locale in the Galaxy. This suggests that cosmic rays could be a significant contributor to interstellar heating. The cosmic-ray ionization rate will be more or less uniform throughout the Galactic disk and also perpendicular to the disk according to the scale height of cosmic rays which may be similar to 1 kpc, thus providing a source of ionization at high Z values. The recent observation of low-energy particle acceleration at the heliospheric termination shock, which produces local ionization rates comparable to those due to Galactic cosmic rays, raises the interesting possibility that "hot spots," where the ionization rate due to locally accelerated particles may exceed 10(-16) s(-1) (H atom), may occur near massive stars with more powerful stellar winds.

SO ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
AB The cross section of the Sm-144(alpha, gamma) Gd-148 reaction has been measured at bombarding energies in the 10.5-13.4 MeV range using an activation method based on the off-line alpha-activity measurement of the Gd-148 residual nucleus. The long measuring time of the alpha-decay has required the use of etched track detectors. The resulting cross sections and astrophysical S-factors are compared to new statistical model calculations. The measured data at low energies reflect the strong energy dependence of the optical potential which is found to affect significantly our predictions of the alpha-capture rate.

TI The spatial distributions of cooling gas and intrinsic X-ray-absorbing
   material in cooling flows
SO MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
AB We present the results from a study of the spatial distributions of cooling gas and intrinsic X-ray-absorbing material in a sample of nearby, X-ray-bright cooling flow clusters observed with the Position Sensitive Proportional Counter (PSPC) on ROSAT. Our method of analysis employs X-ray colour profiles, formed from ratios of the surface brightness profiles of the clusters in selected energy bands, and an adapted version of the deprojection code of Fabian et al. We show that all of the cooling flow clusters in our sample exhibit significant central concentrations of cooling gas. At larger radii the clusters appear approximately isothermal. In detail, the spatial distributions and emissivity of the cooling material are shown to be in excellent agreement with the predictions from the deprojection code, and can be used to constrain the ages of the cooling hows. The X-ray colour profiles also indicate substantial levels of intrinsic X-ray absorption in the clusters. The intrinsic absorption increases with decreasing radius, and is confined to the regions occupied by the cooling flows. We explore a range of Likely spatial distributions for the absorbing gas and discuss the complexities involved in the measurement of column densities from X-ray data. We show that the application of simple spectral models, in which the intrinsic absorber is treated as a uniform foreground screen, will naturally lead to significant underestimates of the true amounts of absorption. Comparison of our results with previously reported observations made with the Einstein Observatory Solid State Spectrometer shows reasonable agreement, but requires that the absorbing material only partially covers the X-ray-emitting regions. The mass of absorbing gas in the central (30 arcsec radius) regions of the clusters calculated under the assumption of solar metallicity in the absorbing material can be accumulated by the cooling flows on timescales of a few 10(8) yr, which are much less than the ages of the flows. This implies that most of the material deposited by the cooling flows in these regions cannot remain in X-ray-absorbing gas. The results presented in this paper provide strong support for the standard model of inhomogeneous cooling hows in clusters of galaxies.

AB A continuous climate record since 1951 at Niwot Ridge in the Colorado Front Range shows a decline in mean annual temperature, an increase in annual precipitation amount, and a decrease in mean daily solar radiation for the summer months. The increase in precipitation amount explains about half of the 200% increase in annual wet deposition of NO3- to Niwot Ridge over the last decade. Differences in climate parameters between 1994 and 1995 (increased snow depth and decreased net energy flux to the snowpack) resulted in a 4-5-fold increase in the magnitude of solute release from the snowpack in the form of an ionic pulse. In turn, the high chemical loading of strong acid anions in the seasonal snowpack and release of these solutes from the seasonal snowpack in the form of an ionic pulse is causing episodic acidification (ANC < 0 mu eq liter(-1)) in headwater catchments at present deposition levels. Small changes in climate parameters may cause large changes in the hydrochemistry of alpine streams. The changes in climate at Niwot Ridge are not in synchrony with lowland warming in the Great Plains to the east and serve as a reminder that climate in alpine areas is driven by local conditions and may be asynchronous with regional and global climate trends.

TI Angular momentum transport in accretion disks via convection
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB In this paper, we investigate, by three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, the role that vertical convective motions play in providing angular momentum transport in a Keplerian disk. We begin by deriving simple and general analytic constraints upon the correlated radial and azimuthal velocity fluctuation tensor, critical to the direction of energy and angular momentum transport. When azimuthal pressure gradients are small, as is often the case for incompressible turbulence in a shearing disk, the constraints are particularly straightforward and striking: they imply there can be no net outward transport in a steady flow. (More precisely, any steady transport that is present must be due to the explicit forcing by azimuthal pressure gradients.) Furthermore, numerical simulations show inward transport even in disks characterized by solid body rotation, which are quite far from axisymmetric. If the kinetic energy of rotational velocity fluctuations increases with time because of coupling with the mean flow (as in an instability), the relationship suggests (and our numerical simulations confirm) that in a Keplerian disk the Reynolds stress is negative, i.e., that the angular momentum and energy transport is inward. The analogous relationship for shearing but nonrotating (Cartesian) flow displays the opposite sign for the fluctuation tensor, i.e., an increase in the ''streamwise'' velocity fluctuations is associated with outward (from higher momentum to smaller momentum) transport. Although Cartesian shear flows are known to be extremely sensitive to disruption by nonlinear secondary instabilities, hydrodynamical calculations presented here demonstrate that Keplerian disk flows show no such inclination. We suggest that the key to understanding this critical difference is the very different nature of the interaction between the mean flow and the transport in each system. We provide a physical interpretation of our findings in terms of the role epicyclic oscillations play in mediating angular momentum transport.
   We base our convection simulations upon a reproducible analytic expression for the vertical profile of an unstable equilibrium state in a stratified disk. The nonlinear evolution of the convective cells is then followed after the initial profile is perturbed. Convection can be sustained only if an ad hoc source of heating is added to the disk midplane. The net transport associated with steady convection is small and on average inward. A comparison between the volume-averaged Reynolds stress and the time rate of change of the azimuthal kinetic energy associated with fluctuations in the rotational velocity shows remarkable agreement with our simple analytic predictions.
   Taken as a whole, these results offer little hope that convection-or any other form of incompressible hydrodynamic turbulence-is likely to be a significant source of angular momentum transport in nonmagnetic disks. Coherent pressure forcing by, e.g., spiral density waves, remains a viable option.

TI A revised land surface parameterization (SiB2) for GCMs .3. The greening
   of the Colorado State University general circulation model
SO JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
AB SiB2, the second-generation land-surface parameterization developed by Sellers et al., has been incorporated into the Colorado State University general circulation model and tested in multidecade simulations. The control run uses a ''bucket'' hydrology but employs the same surface albedo and surface roughness distributions as the SiB2 run.
   Results show that SiB2 leads to a general warming of the continents, as evidenced in the ground temperature, surface air temperature, and boundary-layer-mean potential temperature. The surface sensible heat flux increases and the latent heat flux decreases. This warming occurs virtually everywhere but is most spectacular over Siberia in winter.
   Precipitation generally decreases over land but increases in the monsoon regions, especially the Amazon basin in January and equatorial Africa and Southeast Asia in July. Evaporation decreases considerably, especially in dry regions such as the Sahara. The excess of precipitation over evaporation increases in the monsoon regions.
   The precipitable water (vertically integrated water vapor content) generally decreases over land but increases in the monsoon regions. The mixing ratio of the boundary-layer air decreases over nearly all continental areas, however, including the monsoon regions. The average (composite) maximum boundary-layer depth over the diurnal cycle increases in the monsoon regions, as does the average PBL turbulence kinetic energy. The average boundary-layer wind speed also increases over most continental regions.
   Groundwater content generally increases in rainy regions and decreases in dry regions, so that SiB2 has a tendency to increase its spatial variability. SiB2 leads to a general reduction of cloudiness over land. The net surface longwave cooling of the surface increases quite dramatically over land, in accordance with the increased surface temperatures and decreased cloudiness. The solar radiation absorbed at the ground also increases.
   SiB2 has modest effects on the simulated general circulation of the atmosphere. Its most important impacts on the model are to improve the simulations of surface temperature and snow cover and to enable the simulation of the net rate of terrestrial carbon assimilation.

TI PHENOMENOLOGY FOR THE DECAY OF ENERGY-CONTAINING EDDIES IN HOMOGENEOUS
   MHD TURBULENCE
SO PHYSICS OF FLUIDS
AB We evaluate a number of simple, one-point phenomenological models for the decay of energy-containing eddies in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and hydrodynamic turbulence. The MHD models include effects of cross helicity and Alfvenic couplings associated with a constant mean magnetic field, based on physical effects well-described in the literature. The analytic structure of three separate MHD models is discussed. The single hydrodynamic model and several MHD models are compared against results from spectral-method simulations. The hydrodynamic model phenomenology has been previously verified against experiments in wind tunnels, and certain experimentally determined parameters in the model are satisfactorily reproduced by the present simulation. This agreement supports the suitability of our numerical calculations for examining MHD turbulence, where practical difficulties make it more difficult to study physical examples. When the triple-decorrelation time and effects of spectral anisotropy are properly taken into account, particular MHD models give decay rates that remain correct to within a factor of 2 for several energy-halving times. A simple model of this type is likely to be useful in a number of applications in space physics, astrophysics, and laboratory plasma physics where the approximate effects of turbulence need to be included.

TI HELIOCENTRIC ZONING OF THE ASTEROID BELT BY AL-26 HEATING
SO SCIENCE
AB The dependence of asteroid spectral class (and inferred composition and thermal history) on heliocentric radius has been held to be the result of heating by a solar energy source, most likely electrical induction, during the formation of the planetary system. Such variations in thermal history can be more simply explained by the presence of different amounts of the radionuclide aluminum-26, whose decay products are observed in meteorites, in planetesimals. These differences occurred naturally as a function of the increasing amount of time required to accrete objects farther from the sun, during which aluminum-26 decayed from its initial concentration in the solar nebula. Both theory and isotopic evidence suggest that increases in accretion time across the asteroid belt are of order several half-lives of aluminum-26, which is sufficient to produce the inferred differences in thermal history.

TI THE GREAT FLARE OF 1985 APRIL 12 ON AD LEONIS
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB Photometric and spectroscopic observations covering the wavelength range 1200-8000 angstrom are presented for a giant flare on the M dwarf star AD Leo.  The flare radiated more than 10(34) ergs in this wavelength region and lasted for more than 4 hr.  The magnitude and duration of the flare allowed us to obtain an unprecedented view of the response of the lower atmosphere.  For the first time, a flare energy budget over the entire optical and ultraviolet wavelength region is constructed as a function of time during the flare.  The continuum radiation is shown to be the dominant source of energy loss during both the initial "impulsive" phase and the later "gradual" phase.  The emission lines contribute less than 10% of the total flare energy in this wavelength region but are about 4 times more important during the gradual phase than in the impulsive phase.  The energy budget is compared in detail with another, less energetic, flare on AD Leo and found to be quite similar.  A sample of nine well-observed flares on stars with spectral type ranging from dM3.5e to dM5.5e was then used to investigate the relationships between the integrated properties of several flare emission features.  Good correlation between H-gamma and Ca II K emission, and H-gamma and U filter emission was found, extending the previously known correlation of H-gamma with soft X-ray emission.  These correlations suggest that the observed emission features are produced under similar atmospheric conditions regardless of the total flare energy emitted.  The range in total emitted energy may thus be primarily a function of flare area and duration, and not of large differences in flare heating rate and resulting atmospheric structure.  In addition, the time evolution of the emission features is qualitatively similar for a large number of flares, and quantitatively similar for the two flares studied in detail.  This suggests that the energy source and deposition mechanisms which operate during the impulsive and gradual phases are causally connected, in agreement with current models for solar flares.

TI Quantitatively Analyzing the Influence of Side Chains on Photovoltaic
   Properties of Polymer-Fullerene Solar Cells
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Conventional wisdom dictates that the band gap and energy levels of a conjugated polymer are primarily determined by the molecular structure of the conjugated backbone, while the solubilizing alkyl chains should have a negligible impact on these properties. Hence the side chains should have minimal impact on the short circuit current (J(sc)) and open circuit voltage (V(oc)) of corresponding polymer based bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. Contrary to the "conventional wisdom", we demonstrate that the side chain of a low band gap polymer (PNDT-DTBT) significantly impacts the observed V(oc) and J(sc) of the corresponding BHJ solar cell with variations as much as 100%, depending upon the length and shape of these alkyl chains. The observed difference in V(oc) and J(sc) is quantitatively correlated with a pre-exponential dark current term, J(sc), which accounts for the intermolecular interactions in the polymer/PCBM blends.

TI Ordered TiO2 Nanotube Arrays on Transparent Conductive Oxide for
   Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells
SO CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS
AB Synthesizing highly ordered 1-D TiO2 nanostructures directly on transparent conductive oxides (TCO), which is of key interest for fabricating front-side illuminating dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), has been one of the most challenging nanofabrication tasks. Here, we present a process for synthesizing vertically aligned TiO2 nanotube arrays on TCO through a liquid-phase Conversion process using ZnO nanowire arrays as a template. The resulting TiO2, nanotube arrays can be easily integrated with the fabrication process of DSCs and lead to significantly improved photovoltaic performance compared to ZnO nanowire-based DSCs. It is also observed that the lifetime of photogenerated electrons in TiO2 nanotubes is more than an order of magnitude larger than that in sintered TiO2 nanoparticles. This result opens tip numerous Opportunities to further improve DSCs, for example, by employing solid-state electrolytes and redox mediators with faster kinetics, which otherwise would be challenging or impossible to implement by the use of nanoparticle-based DSCs.

Thus lowering the energy requirements for the semiconductor synthesis step or making it more energy-efficient is critical toward making the overall device economics more competitive relative to other nonpolluting energy options. In this communication, combustion synthesis is demonstrated to be a versatile and energy-efficient method for preparing inorganic oxide semiconductors such as tungsten trioxide (WO3) for photovoltaic or photocatalytic solar energy conversion. The energy efficiency of combustion synthesis accrues from the fact that high process temperatures are self-sustained by the exothermicity of the combustion process, and the only external thermal energy input needed is for dehydration of the fuel/oxidizer precursor mixture and bringing it to ignition, Importantly, we show that, in this approach, it is also possible to tune the optical characteristics of the oxide semiconductor (i.e., shift its response toward the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum) in situ by doping the host semiconductor during the formative stage itself. As a bonus, the resultant material shows enhanced surface properties such as markedly improved organic dye uptake relative to benchmark samples obtained from commercial sources. Finally, this synthesis approach requires only very simple equipment, a feature that it shares with other "mild" inorganic semiconductor synthesis routes such as Sol-gel chemistry, chemical bath deposition, and electrodeposition. The present study constitutes the first use of combustion synthesis for preparing WO3 powder comprising nanosized particles.

TI Electrodeposited nanoporous ZnO films exhibiting enhanced performance in
   dye-sensitized solar cells
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Electrodeposition of nanoporous ZnO films and their applications to dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were investigated in the aim of developing cost-effective alternative synthetic methods and improving the ZnO-based DSSCs performance. ZnO films were grown by cathodic electrodeposition from an aqueous zinc nitrate solution containing polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) surfactant. PVP concentration had strong effects on the grain sizes and surface morphologies of ZnO films. Nanoporous ZnO film with grain size of 20-40 nm was obtained in the electrolyte containing 4 g/L PVP. The X-ray diffraction pattern showed that nanoporous ZnO films had a hexagonal wurtzite structure. Optical properties of such films were studied and the results indicated that the films had a band gap of 3.3 eV. DSSCs were fabricated from nanoporous ZnO films and the cell performance could be greatly improved with the increase of ZnO film thickness. The highest solar-to-electric energy conversion efficiency of 5.08% was obtained by using the electrodeposited double-layer ZnO films (8 mu m thick nanoporous ZnO films on a 200 nm thick compact nanocrystalline ZnO film). The performance of such cell surpassed levels attained in previous studies on ZnO film-based DSSCs and was among the highest for DSSCs containing electrodeposited film components.

TI Three-dimensional MHD simulation of a flux rope driven CME
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
AB We present a three-dimensional (3-D) numerical ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model, describing the time-dependent expulsion of plasma and magnetic flux from the solar corona that resembles a coronal mass ejection (CME). We begin by developing a global steady-state model of the corona and solar wind that gives a reasonable description of the solar wind conditions near solar minimum. The model magnetic field possesses high-latitude coronal holes and closed field lines at low latitudes in the form of a helmet streamer belt with a current sheet at the solar equator. We further reproduce the fast and slow speed solar wind at high and low latitudes, respectively. Within this steady-state heliospheric model, conditions for a CME are created by superimposing the magnetic field and plasma density of the 3-D Gibson-Low flux rope inside the coronal streamer belt. The CME is launched by initial force imbalance within the flux rope resulting in its rapid acceleration to a speed of over 1000 km/s and then decelerates, asymptotically approaching a final speed near 600 km/s. The CME is characterized by the bulk expulsion of similar to10(16) g of plasma from the corona with a maximum of similar to5 x 10(31) ergs of kinetic energy. This energy is derived from the free magnetic energy associated with the cross-field currents, which is released as the flux rope expands. The dynamics of the CME are followed as it interacts with the bimodal solar wind. We also present synthetic white-light coronagraph images of the model CME, which show a two-part structure that can be compared with coronagraph observations of CMEs.

AB Materials displaying the remarkable combination of high electrical conductivity and optical transparency already from the basis of many important technological applications, including flat panel displays, solar energy capture and other opto-electronic devices. Here we present the basic materials physics of these important materials centred on the nature of the doping process to generate n-type conductivity in transparent conducting oxides, the associated transition to the metallic (conducting) state and the detailed properties of the degenerate itinerant electron gas. The aim is to fully understand the origins of the basic performance limits of known materials and to set the scene for new or improved materials which will breach those limits for new-generation transparent conducting materials, either oxides, or beyond oxides.

TI In-situ formation of light-absorbing organic matter in cloud water
SO JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY
AB Current climate models seem to underestimate the flux of solar energy absorbed by the global troposphere. All of these models are constrained with the assumption that cloud droplets consist of pure water. Here we demonstrate in a simple laboratory experiment that aromatic hydroxy-cids which are found in continental fine aerosol can react with hydroxyl radicals under typical conditions prevalent in cloud water influenced by biomass burning. The reactions yield colored organic species which do absorb solar radiation. We also suggest that the products of such reactions may be humic-like substances whose presence in continental aerosol has been confirmed but their source mechanisms are still much sought after. We also attempt to give a first order estimate of the enhancement of water absorption at a visible wavelength under atmospheric conditions.

TI RHESSI and trace observations of the 21 April 2002 X1.5 flare
SO SOLAR PHYSICS
AB Observations of the X1.5 flare on 21 April 2002 are reviewed using the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) and the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE). The major findings are as follows: (1) The 3 - 25 keV X-rays started < 4 min before the EUV (195 &ANGS;) emission suggesting that the initial energy release heated plasma directly to &GSIM;20 MK, well above the 1.6 MK needed to produce the FeXII (195 &ANGS;) line. (2) Using coaligned 12-25 keV RHESSI and TRACE images, further evidence is found for the existence of hot (15-20 MK) plasma in the 195&ANGS; passband. This hot, diffuse emission is attributed to the presence of the Fe XXIV (192&ANGS;) line within the TRACE 195 &ANGS; passband. (3) The 12-25 keV source centroid moves away from the limb with an apparent velocity of &SIM;9.9 km s(-1), slowing to &SIM; 1.7 km s(-1) after 3 hours, its final altitude being - 140 Mm after - 12 hours. This suggests that the energy release site moves to higher altitudes in agreement with classical flare models. (4) The 50-100 keV emission correlates well with EUV flare ribbons, suggesting thick-target interactions at the footpoints of the magnetic arcade. The 50-100 keV time profile matches the time derivative of the GOES light curve (Neupert effect), which suggests that the same electrons that produced the thick-target hard X-ray emission also heat the plasma seen in soft X-rays. (5) X-ray footpoint emission has an E-3 spectrum down to &SIM;10 keV suggesting a lower electron cutoff energy than previously thought. (6) The hard X-ray (25 - 200 keV) peaks have FWHM durations of &SIM;1 min suggesting a more gradual energy release process than expected. (7) The TRACE images reveal a bright symmetric front propagating away from the main flare site at speeds of &GE; 120 km s(-1). This may be associated with the fast CME observed several minutes later by LASCO. (8) Dark sinuous lanes are observed in the TRACE images that extend almost radially from the post-flare loop system. This 'fan of spines' becomes visible well into the decay phase of the flare and shows evidence for both lateral and downward motions.

TI Dynamic multiphysics model for solar array
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENERGY CONVERSION
AB An approach to model the solar cell system with coupled multiphysics equations (photovoltaic, electro-thermal, direct heating and cooling processes) within the context of the resistive-companion method in the Virtual Test Bed computational environment is presented. Appropriate across and through variables are defined for the thermal terminal of the system so that temperature is properly represented as a state variable, rather than as a parameter of the system. This allows enforcement of the system power conservation through all terminals, and allows simultaneous solutions for both the electrical potentials and the system temperature. The thermal port built accordingly can be used for natural thermal coupling.
   The static and dynamic behaviors of the solar array model based on the approach are obtained and validated through comparison of simulation results to theoretical predictions and other reported data. The electro-thermal modeling method developed here can be generally used in the modeling of other devices, and the method to define the across and through variables can also be generalized to any other interdisciplinary processes where natural coupling is required.

CT Meeting on Stratospheric Processes and Their Role in Climate (SPARC)
CY NOV 09-11, 2000
CL MAR DEL PLATA, ARGENTINA
AB Solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR, 290-400 nm) is a crucial environmental factor in alpine lakes because of the natural increase of the UVR flux with elevation and the high water transparency of these ecosystems. The ecological importance of UVR, however, has only recently been recognized. This review, examines the general features of alpine lakes regarding UVR, summarizes what is known about the role of solar UVR in the ecology of alpine lakes, and identifies future research directions. Unlike the pattern observed in most lowland lakes, variability of UV attenuation in alpine lakes is poorly explained by differences in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, and depends mainly on optical characteristics (absorption) of the chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Within the water column of lakes with low DOC concentrations (0.2-0.4 mg l(-1)), UV attenuation is influenced by phytoplankton whose development at depth (i.e. the deep chlorophyll maximum) causes important changes in UV attenuation. Alpine aquatic organisms have developed a number of strategies to minimize UV damage. The widespread synthesis or bioaccumulation of different compounds that directly or indirectly absorb UV energy is one such strategy. Although most benthic and planktonic primary producers and crustacean zooplankton. are well adapted to high intensities of solar radiation, heterotrophic protists, bacteria, and viruses seem to be particularly sensitive to UVR. Understanding the overall impact of UVR on alpine lakes would need to consider synergistic and antagonistic processes resulting from the pronounced climatic warming, which have the potential to modify the UV underwater climate and consequently the stress on aquatic organisms.

TI Nanostructured thin films of C-60-aniline dyad clusters:
   Electrodeposition, charge separation, and photoelectrochemistry
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB Clusters of C-60 - aniline dyads are deposited as thin films on nanostructured SnO2 electrodes under the influence of an electric field. At low applied DC voltage (<5 V) the clusters in toluene/acetonitrile (1:3) mixed solvent grow in size (from 160 nm to <similar to>200 nm in diameter) while at higher voltages (>50 V) they are deposited on the electrode surface as thin films. The C-60 - aniline dyad cluster films when cast on nanostructured SnO2 films are photoelectrochemically active and generate photocurrent under visible light excitation. These nanostructured fullerene films are capable of delivering relatively large photocurrents (upto similar to0.2 mA cm(-2), photoconversion efficiency of 3-4%) when employed as photoanodes in photoelectrochemical cells Both luminescence and transient absorption studies confirm the formation of charge transfer product (C-60 anion) following UV/Vis excitation of these films, Photo-induced charge separation in these dyad clusters is followed by the electron injection from C-60-anion moiety into the SnO2 nanocrystallites. The oxidized counterpart is reduced by the redox couple present in the electrolyte, thus regenerating the dyad clusters. The feasibility of casting high surface area thin fullerene films on electrode surfaces has opened up new avenues to utilize dyad molecules of sensitizer bridge donor type in light energy conversion devices, such as solar cells.

TI Three-dimensional stereoscopic analysis of solar active region loops.
   II. SOHO/EIT observations at temperatures of 1.5-2.5 MK
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB In this paper we study the three-dimensional structure of hot (T-e approximate to 1.5-2.5 MK) loops in solar active region NOAA 7986, observed on 1996 August 30 with the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). This complements a first study (Paper I) on cooler (T-e approximate to 1.0-1.5 MK) loops of the same active region, using the same method of Dynamic Stereoscopy to reconstruct the three-dimensional geometry. We reconstruct the three-dimensional coordinates x(s), y(s), z(s), the density n(e)(s), and temperature profile T-e(s) of 35 individual loop segments las a function of the loop coordinate s) using EIT 195 and 284 Angstrom images. The major findings are as follows. II) All loops are found to be in hydrostatic equilibrium, in the entire temperature regime of T-e = 1.0-2.5 MK. (2) The analyzed loops have a height of 2-3 scale heights, and thus only segments extending over about one vertical scale height have sufficient emission measure contrast for detection. (3) The temperature gradient over the lowest scale height is of order dT/ds approximate to 1-10 K km(-1). (4) The radiative loss rate is found to exceed the conductive loss rate by about two orders or magnitude in the coronal loop segments, implying that the loops cannot be in quasi-static equilibrium, since standard steady-state loop models show that radiative and conductive losses are comparable. (5) A steady state could only be maintained if the heating rate E-H matches exactly the radiative loss rate in hydrostatic equilibrium, requiring a heat deposition length II, of the half density scale height ii. (6) We find a correlation of p proportional to L-1 between loop base pressure and loop length, which is not consistent with the scaling law predicted from steady-state models of large-scale loops. All observational findings indicate consistently that the energy balance of the observed EUV loops cannot be described by steady-state models.

TI Donor-acceptor interaction between non-aqueous solvents and I-2 to
   generate I-3(-), and its implication in dye sensitized solar cells
SO SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS
AB The spectrophotometric properties of I-, I-2 and the I-/I-2, mixture were studied in 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE), acetone (AC), acetonitrile (ACN), ethanol (EtOH), methanol (MeOH), tertiary-butanol (t-BuOH), dimethylformamide (DMF), propylenecarbonate (PC), 3-methoxypropionitrile (MePN), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), dioxane (DIO) and pyridine (PY) solutions. From the investigation it has been realized that in DCE, I-, I-2 and I-/I-2 mixture have the same absorption peak at 500 nm. I- gives rise to the absorption spectra at about 220, 290 and 360 nm in t-BuOH and in PY solutions. However, in all other solvents the I- generates peaks only around 220 nm. Similarly I-2 and the I-/I-2 mixture in all solvents except DCE have indicated similar absorption peaks around 220, 290 and 360 nm, On the other hand, except in PC and DMF, I-2 shows the additional peaks in the range of 380-500 nm which are assigned to the formation of a I-2-solvent complex. The peaks around 290 and 360 nm indicate the presence of I-3(-) and around 220 nm is the peak of I-. The spectral shift of the I-2 solutions in the visible region is interesting and is the core of this report. It points to the importance of donor-acceptor interaction between solvents and iodine. The data obtained in these solvents were well correlated to the donor number (DN) of the solvents. From this correlation the DN of MePN was estimated to 14.6. The absorption peak of I-2 in DCE(DN = 0.0) is 500 nm and in PY(DN = 33.1) is 378 nm. This peak shift due to solvent effects corresponds to an energy difference close to 0.8 eV. The absorption peak shift due to addition of the 0.0080 vol%. PY(1 mM) in 1 mM I-2-ACN solutions corresponds to ca. 0.6 eV. The blue shift of I-2 absorption in basic solvents indicates the tendency to form a complex. The increase of the efficiency of the dye-sensitized solar cell by addition of PY to I-/I-3(-) ACN solution is suggested to be due to the formation of the dipyridine complex, PY2I+. Such complex formation decreases the amount of I-2 which is expected to be an electron scavenger. We also propose that the more bulky complex, PY2I+ has a slower kinetics with the conduction band electrons, and thus decrease the losses of photocurrent and photopotentials in the solar cell.

TI A SIMPLE ENERGY BUDGET ALGORITHM FOR THE SNOWMELT RUNOFF MODEL
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
AB The snowmelt runoff model (SRM) uses a degree-day approach for melting snow in a basin. A simple radiation component was combined with the degree-day approach (restricted degree-day method) in an effort to improve estimates of snowmelt and reduce the need to adjust the melt factor over the ablation season. A daily energy balance model was formulated that requires not only the input of radiation but also measurements of daily wind speed, air temperature, and relative humidity. The three approaches for computing snowmelt, namely, the degree-day, restricted degree-day, and daily energy balance model were tested at the local scale by comparing melt rates with lysimeter outflow measurements. Because radiation measurements are not often available, a simple model for simulating shortwave and longwave components of the radiation balance that requires minimal information (i.e., daily cloud cover estimates, air temperature, and relative humidity) was developed It was found that clouds and their effects on daily insolation at the surface can produce significant differences between measured and model estimates. In the comparisons of snowmelt estimates with the lysimeter outflow, the restricted degree-day method yielded melt rates that were in better agreement with the observed outflow than the degree-day method and were practically the same as estimates given by the energy balance model. A sensitivity analysis of runoff generated with SRM using as input the local snowmelt computations given by the three models and measured outflow from the lysimeter was performed for a basin. A comparison of the synthetic hydrographs for the basin suggests that a radiation-based snowmelt factor may improve runoff predictions at the basin scale.

TI INFLUENCE OF SUBGRID-SCALE HETEROGENEITY IN LEAF-AREA INDEX,
   STOMATAL-RESISTANCE, AND SOIL-MOISTURE ON GRID-SCALE LAND-ATMOSPHERE
   INTERACTIONS
SO JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
AB The statistical representation of multiple land surfaces within a grid cell has received attention as a means to parameterize the nonlinear effects of subgrid-scale heterogeneity on land-atmosphere energy exchange. However, previous analyses have not identified the critical land-surface parameters to which energy exchanges are sensitive; the appropriate number of within-grid-cell classes for a particular parameter, or the effects of interactions among several parameters on the nonlinearity of energy exchanges. The analyses reported here used a land-surface scheme for climate models to examine the effects of subgrid variability in leaf area index, minimum and maximum stomatal resistances, and soil moisture on grid-scale fluxes. Comparisons between energy fluxes obtained using parameter values for the average of 100 subgrid points and the average fluxes for the 100 subgrid points showed minor differences for emitted infrared radiation and reflected solar radiation, but large differences for sensible heat and evapotranspiration. Leaf ama index was the most important parameter; stomatal resistances were only important on wet soils. Interactions among parameters increased the nonlinearity of land-atmosphere energy exchange. When considered separately, six to ten values of each parameter greatly reduced the deviation between the two flux estimates. However, this approach became cumbersome when all four parameters varied independently. These analyses suggest that the debate over how to best parameterize the nonlinear effects of subgrid-scale heterogeneity on land-atmosphere interactions will continue.

TI Alfvenic waves with sufficient energy to power the quiet solar corona
   and fast solar wind
SO NATURE
AB Energy is required to heat the outer solar atmosphere to millions of degrees (refs 1, 2) and to accelerate the solar wind to hundreds of kilometres per second (refs 2-6). Alfven waves (travelling oscillations of ions and magnetic field) have been invoked as a possible mechanism to transport magneto-convective energy upwards along the Sun's magnetic field lines into the corona. Previous observations(7) of Alfvenic waves in the corona revealed amplitudes far too small (0.5 km s(-1)) to supply the energy flux (100-200 W m(-2)) required to drive the fast solar wind(8) or balance the radiative losses of the quiet corona(9). Here we report observations of the transition region (between the chromosphere and the corona) and of the corona that reveal how Alfvenic motions permeate the dynamic and finely structured outer solar atmosphere. The ubiquitous outward-propagating Alfvenic motions observed have amplitudes of the order of 20 km s(-1) and periods of the order of 100-500 s throughout the quiescent atmosphere (compatible with recent investigations(7,10)), and are energetic enough to accelerate the fast solar wind and heat the quiet corona.

TI Tuning the Energy Level of Organic Sensitizers for High-Performance
   Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Cost-effective organic sensitizers will play a pivotal role in the future large-scale production and application of dye-sensitized solar cells. Here we report two new organic D-pi-A dyes featuring electron-rich 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene- and 2,2'-bis(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-conjugated linkers, showing a remarkable red-shifting of photocurrent action spectra compared with their thiophene and bithiophene counterparts. On the basis of the 3-f{5'-[N,N-bis(9,9-dimethylfluorene-2-yl)phenyl]-2,2'-bis(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-5-yl}2-cyanoacrylic acid dye, we have set a new efficiency record of 7.6% for solvent-free dye-sensitized solar cells based on metal-free organic sensitizers. Importantly, the cell exhibits an excellent stability, keeping over 92% of its initial efficiency after 1000 h accelerated tests under full sunlight soaking at 60 degrees C. This achievement will considerably encourage further design and exploration of metal-free organic dyes for higher performance dye-sensitized solar cells. We have also scrutinized the physical origins of the relatively low photocurrent and photovoltage obtained with an ionic liquid electrolyte compared to a volatile acetonitrile-based electrolyte through transient and modulated photoelectrical measurements.

TI Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting Using Dense and Aligned TiO2
   Nanorod Arrays
SO SMALL
AB Dense and aligned TiO2 nanorod arrays are fabricated using oblique-angle deposition on indium tin oxide (ITO) conducting substrates. The TiO2 nanorods are measured to be 800-1100 nm in length and 45-400 nm in width with an anatase crystal phase. Coverage of the ITO is extremely high with 25 x 10(6) mm(-2) of the TiO2 nanorods. The first use of these dense TiO2 nanorod arrays as working electrodes in photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells used for the generation of hydrogen by water splitting is demonstrated. A number of experimental techniques including UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, high-resolution scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and photoelectrochemistry are used to characterize their structural, optical, and electronic properties. Both UV/Vis and incident-photon-to-current-efficiency measurements show their photoresponse in the visible is limited but with a marked increase around approximate to 400 nm. Mott-Schottky measurements give a flat-band potential (V-FB) of +0.20 V, a carrier density of 4.5 x 10(17) cm(-3), and a space-charge layer of 99 nm. Overall water splitting is observed with an applied overpotential at 1.0 V (versus Ag/AgCl) with a photo-to-hydrogen efficiency of 0.1%. The results suggest that these dense and aligned one-dimensional TiO2 nanostructures are promising for hydrogen generation from water splitting based on PEC cells.

TI Star cluster disruption by giant molecular clouds
SO MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
AB We investigate encounters between giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and star clusters. We propose a single expression for the energy gain of a cluster due to an encounter with a GMC, valid for all encounter distances and GMC properties. This relation is verified with N-body simulations of cluster-GMC encounters, where the GMC is represented by a moving analytical potential. Excellent agreement is found between the simulations and the analytical work for fractional energy gains of Delta E/vertical bar E-0 vertical bar < 10, where vertical bar E-0 vertical bar is the initial total cluster energy. The fractional mass loss from the cluster scales with the fractional energy gain as (Delta M/M-0) = f(Delta E/vertical bar E-0 vertical bar), where f similar or equal to 0.25. This is because a fraction 1 - f of the injected energy goes to the velocities of escaping stars, that are higher than the escape velocity. We therefore suggest that the disruption time of clusters, t(dis), is best defined as the time needed to bring the cluster mass to zero, instead of the time needed to inject the initial cluster energy. We derive an expression for t(dis) based on the mass loss from the simulations, taking into account the effect of gravitational focusing by the GMC. Assuming spatially homogeneous distributions of clusters and GMCs with a relative velocity dispersion of sigma(cn), we find that clusters lose most of their mass in relatively close encounters with high relative velocities (similar to 2 sigma(cn)). The disruption time depends on the cluster mass (M-c) and half-mass radius (r(h)) as t(dis) = 2.0 S(M-c/10(4) M-circle dot)(3.75 pc/r(h))(3) Gyr, with S equivalent to 1 for the solar neighbourhood and S scales with the surface density of individual GMCs (Sigma(n)) and the global GMC density (rho(n)) as S proportional to (Sigma(n)rho(n))(-1). Combined with the observed relation between r(h) and M-c, that is, r(h) proportional to M-c(lambda), t(dis) depends on M-c as t(dis)proportional to M-c(gamma). The index gamma is then defined as gamma= 1 - 3 lambda. The observed shallow relation between cluster radius and mass (e.g. lambda similar or equal to 0.1), makes the value of the index gamma = 0.7 similar to that found from observations and from simulations of clusters dissolving in tidal fields (gamma similar or equal to 0.62). The constant of 2.0 Gyr, which is the disruption time of a 10(4) M circle dot cluster in the solar neighbourhood, is about a factor of 3.5 shorter than that found from earlier simulations of clusters dissolving under the combined effect of Galactic tidal field and stellar evolution. It is somewhat higher than the observationally determined value of 1.3 Gyr. It suggests, however, that the combined effect of tidal field and encounters with GMCs can explain the lack of old open clusters in the solar neighbourhood. GMC encounters can also explain the (very) short disruption time that was observed for star clusters in the central region of M51, since there rho(n) is an order of magnitude higher than that in the solar neighbourhood.

TI Flux-transport dynamos with Lorentz force feedback on differential
   rotation and meridional flow: Saturation mechanism and torsional
   oscillations
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB In this paper we discuss a dynamic flux-transport dynamo model that includes the feedback of the induced magnetic field on differential rotation and meridional flow. We consider two different approaches for the feedback: mean field Lorentz force and quenching of transport coefficients such as turbulent viscosity and heat conductivity. We find that even strong feedback on the meridional flow does not change the character of the flux-transport dynamo significantly; however, it leads to a significant reduction of differential rotation. To a large degree independent of the dynamo parameters, the saturation takes place when the toroidal field at the base of the convection zone reaches between 1.2 and 1.5 T, and the energy converted into magnetic energy corresponds to about 0.1%-0.2% of the solar luminosity. The torsional oscillations produced through Lorentz force feedback on differential rotation show a dominant poleward propagating branch with the correct phase relation to the magnetic cycle. We show that incorporating enhanced surface cooling of the active region belt (as proposed by Spruit) leads to an equatorward propagating branch in good agreement with observations.

CY MAY 31-JUN 03, 2005

AB The Quantum Dot Intermediate Band Solar Cell (QD-IBSC) has been proposed for studying experimentally the operating principles of a generic class of photovoltaic devices, the intermediate band solar cells (IBSC). The performance of an IBSC is based on the properties of a semiconductor-like material which is characterised by the existence of an intermediate band (IB) located within what would otherwise be its conventional bandgap. The improvement in efficiency of the cell arises from its potential (i) to absorb below bandgap energy photons and thus produce additional photocurrent, and (ii) to inject this enhanced photocurrent without degrading its output photo-voltage. The implementation of the IBSC using quantum dots (QDs) takes advantage of the discrete nature of the carrier density of states in a 0-dimensional nano-structure, an essential property for realising the IB concept. In the QD-IBSC, the IB arises from the confined electron states in an array of quantum dots. This paper reviews the operation of the first prototype QD-IBSCs and discusses some of the lessons learnt from their characterisation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The geostationary Earth Radiation Budget Project
SO BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
AB This paper reports on a new satellite sensor, the Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget (GERB) experiment. GERB is designed to make the first measurements of the Earth's radiation budget from geostationary orbit. Measurements at high absolute accuracy of the reflected sunlight from the Earth, and the thermal radiation emitted by the Earth are made every 15 min, with a spatial resolution at the subsatellite point of 44.6 km (north-south) by 39.3 km (east-west). With knowledge of the incoming solar constant, this gives the primary forcing and response components of the top-of-atmosphere radiation. The first GERB instrument is an instrument of opportunity on Meteosat-8, a new spin-stabilized spacecraft platform also carrying the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared (SEVIRI) sensor, which is currently positioned over the equator at 3.5 degrees W. This overview of the project includes a description of the instrument design and its preflight and in-flight calibration. An evaluation of the instrument performance after its first year in orbit, including comparisons with data from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) satellite sensors and with Output from numerical models, are also presented. After a brief summary of the data processing system and data products, some of the scientific studies that are being undertaken using these early data are described. This marks the beginning of a decade or more of observations from GERB, as subsequent models will fly on each of the four Meteosat Second Generation satellites.

TI Repeated injections of energy in the first 600ms of the giant flare of
   SGR 1806-20
SO NATURE
AB The massive flare of 27 December 2004 from the soft gamma-ray repeater SGR 1806-20, a possible magnetar(1-3), saturated almost all gamma-ray detectors(4-7), meaning that the profile of the pulse was poorly characterized. An accurate profile is essential to determine physically what was happening at the source. Here we report the unsaturated gamma-ray profile for the first 600 ms of the flare, with a time resolution of 5.48 ms. The peak of the profile (of the order of 10(7) photons cm(-2) s(-1)) was reached similar to 50 ms after the onset of the flare, and was then followed by a gradual decrease with superposed oscillatory modulations possibly representing repeated energy injections with similar to 60-ms intervals. The implied total energy is comparable to the stored magnetic energy in a magnetar (similar to 10(47) erg) based on the dipole magnetic field intensity (similar to 10(15) G), suggesting either that the energy release mechanism was extremely efficient or that the interior magnetic field is much stronger than the external dipole field(2).

TI Design and control strategies of PV-Diesel systems using genetic
   algorithms
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB Hybrid photovoltaic systems (PV-hybrid) use photovoltaic energy combined with other sources of energy, like wind or Diesel. If these hybrid systems are optimally designed, they can be more cost effective and reliable than PV-only systems. However, the design of hybrid systems is complex because of the uncertain renewable energy supplies, load demands and the non-linear characteristics of some components, so the design problem cannot be solved easily by classical optimisation methods. When these methods are not capable of solving the problem satisfactorily, the use of heuristic techniques, such as the Genetic Algorithms, can give better results.
   The authors have developed the HOGA program (Hybrid Optimisation by Genetic Algorithms), a program that uses a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to design a PV-Diesel system (sizing and operation control of a PV-Diesel system). The program has been developed in C++.
   In this paper a PV-Diesel system optimised by HOGA is compared with a stand-alone PV-only system that has been dimensioned using a classical design method based on the available energy under worst-case conditions. In both cases the demand and the solar irradiation are the same. The computational results show the economical advantages of the PV-hybrid system. HOGA is also compared with a commercial program for optimisation. of hybrid systems.
   Furthermore, we show a number of results and conclusions about hybrid systems optimised by HOGA. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Hard X-ray source motions in the 2002 July 23 gamma-ray flare
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB The Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) is used to study the hard X-ray (HXR) source motions of the 2002 July 23 gamma-ray flare. Above 30 keV, at least three HXR sources are observed during the impulsive phase that can be identified with footpoints of coronal magnetic loops that form an arcade. On the northern ribbon of this arcade, a source is seen that moves systematically along the ribbon for more than 10 minutes. On the other ribbon, at least two sources are seen that do not seem to move systematically for more than half a minute, with different sources dominating at different times. The northern source motions are fast during times of strong HXR flux but almost absent during periods with low HXR emission. This is consistent with magnetic reconnection if a higher rate of reconnection of field lines (resulting in a higher footpoint speed) produces more energetic electrons per unit time and therefore more HXR emission. The absence of footpoint motion in one ribbon is inconsistent with simple reconnection models but can be explained if the magnetic configuration there is more complex.

TI Emergy indices and ratios for sustainable material cycles and recycle
   options
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB Emergy (spelled with an m) is the energy required to make a service or product expressed in energy of one form. The emergy used in the life cycles of major building materials as well as the emergy inputs to waste disposal and recycle systems were evaluated. Emergy per mass (expressed as solar emergy per gram [sej/g]) for building materials varied from a low of 0.88 E9 sej/g for wood to a high of 12.53 E9 sej/g for aluminum. Generally, emergy per mass is a good indicator of recycle-ability, where materials with high emergy per mass are more recyclable. Recycling added between 1 (cement) and 234% (wood) to the emergy inputs per gram of building materials. The analysis of materials suggested that recycle of wood may not be advantages on a large scale, but metals, plastic, and glass have very positive benefits. Two types of solid waste disposal systems were evaluated: municipal solid wastes (MSW), and construction and demolition wastes (C&D wastes). Expressed as emergy, the costs of collecting, sorting and landfilling (for 25 years) MSW were 251.0 E6, 8.2 E6 and 37.9 E6 sej/g, respectively. The costs of demolition, collection, sorting and landfilling C&D wastes were 49.0 E6, 21.7 E6, 6.7 E6, and 11.7 E6 sej/g, respectively. Three different recycle trajectories were identified and analyzed: (1) material recycle (the 'standard' recycle of a material where it is used again as the same material [i.e. glass bottles recycled and made again into glass bottles]); (2) by-product use (where a by-product from some process is used to make something entirely different [i.e. flay ash in concrete]); and (3) adaptive reuse (where a material after recycle is reused for an entirely different purpose [i.e. plastic milk cartons are converted into plastic lumber]). Three recycle indices measuring the benefits of various recycle systems suggested that materials that have large refining costs have greatest potential for high recycle benefits and that highest benefits appear to accrue from material recycle systems, followed by adaptive reuse systems and then by byproduct reuse systems.

TI YORP-induced long-term evolution of the spin state of small asteroids
   and meteoroids: Rubincam's approximation
SO ICARUS
AB The rotation states of small asteroids and meteoroids are determined primarily by their collisions, gravitational torques due to the Sun and planets (in the case of close encounters), and internal dissipative effects (that relax the free-precession energy toward the fundamental state of principal-axis rotation). Rubincam has recently pointed out that thermal reemission on irregular-shaped bodies also results in a torque that may secularly change both the rotation rate and the orientation of the spin axis (the so-called YORP effect). Here we pursue investigation of this effect. Keeping the zero thermal-relaxation approximation of Rubincam and the assumption of the principal-axis rotation, we study the YORP effect both for precisely determined shapes of near-Earth asteroids and also for a large statistical sample of automatically generated shapes by the Gaussian-sphere technique of Muinonen. We find that the asymptotic state of the YORP evolution is characterized by an arbitrary value of the obliquity, with higher but nearly equal likelihood of 0degrees/180degrees and 90degrees states. At the adopted approximation, the most typical feature of this end state of the YORP evolution is secular deceleration of the rotation rate, which means that at some instant collisions will randomize the rotation state. In a minority of cases, the final state of the obliquity evolution leads to a permanent acceleration of the body's rotation, eventually resulting in rotational fission. The YORP-induced slow evolution may also play an important role in driving the rotation state of small asteroids toward the resonances between the forced precession due to the solar torque and perturbations of the orbital node and inclination. We find that for small Themis asteroids these resonances are isolated in the relevant range of frequencies, and the YORP evolving rotation may be either temporarily captured or rapidly jump across these resonances. In contrast, the possible values of the forced precession for small Flora asteroids may be resonant with clustered, nonisolated lines of the orbital perturbation. The individual rotation histories of small Flora asteroids may be thus very complicated and basically unpredictable. comment on possible astronomical consequences of these results.

AB Semiconductor-metal nanocomposites provide a simple and convenient way to tailor the properties of photocatalysts. Modification of semiconductor surface improves charge separation and promotes interfacial charge-transfer processes in nanocomposite systems. Charge accumulation in the metal layer results in Fermi-level equilibration raising the quasi-Fermi level of the composite close to the conduction band level of the oxide semiconductor. Phototransformations of such composites-including morphological changes, interfacial charge-transfer processes and photocurrent generation of TiO2-capped gold colloids-are presented in this review article.

TI Energy and water dynamics of a central Amazonian rain forest
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
AB This paper presents measurements of the energy and water budgets of a tropical rain forest near Manaus, Brazil, in central Amazonia, collected between September 1995 and August 1996. Fluxes of sensible and latent heat were measured using a three-dimensional eddy covariance system mounted above the forest canopy. Using a new approach to analysis of eddy covariance data, we found that the measured fluxes increased significantly when turbulent transport on timescales of 1 to 4 hours was taken into account. With this new analysis, the measured turbulent fluxes almost balanced the incoming net radiation, giving increased confidence in the accuracy of the measured fluxes. Of the 5.56 GJ m(-2) yr(-1) of solar radiation supplied over the year, 11% were reflected, 15% were lost as net thermal emission, 27% were transported through sensible heat convection, 46% used in evapotranspiration, and 0.5% were used in net carbon fixation. Total annual evapotranspiration was calculated to be 1123 mm, accounting for 54% of total precipitation. Seasonality was an important influence: limited water availability during the dry season caused evapotranspiration to reduce by 50%. Total canopy conductance was linearly correlated to soil moisture content, with typical midday values ranging between 0.8 mol m(-2) s(-1) in the wet season and 0.3 mol m(-2) s(-1) in the dry season. Such seasonal behavior is likely to be prevalent in most tropical forest regions, and correct description of dry-season evapotranspiration will require accurate modeling of plant and soil hydraulic properties and knowledge of root distributions.

TI Reduced light increases herbivore production due to stoichiometric
   effects of light/nutrient balance
SO ECOLOGY
AB Ecological common sense says that decreased solar energy should reduce herbivore production because of reduced energy flow through primary producers. However, a field experiment in a phosphorus-limited lake showed that production of zooplankton herbivores was increased by shading. This paradoxical outcome was caused by a decoupling of producer carbon fixation and nutrient uptake under high light that reduced food quality for herbivores. At low nutrient supplies, shading increased nutrient contents relative to carbon within algal food, outweighing effects of decreased primary production. Thus, light/ nutrient balance affects the degree of mismatch between primary producers and herbivores in nature, which in turn influences mass-transfer efficiencies along food chains. To predict how energy transfer efficiency and biological interactions will respond to perturbations, it is essential to take into account changes in light/nutrient balance and its effects on the stoichiometry of autotroph-herbivore interactions.

TI Global simulations of differentially rotating magnetized disks:
   Formation of low-beta filaments and structured coronae
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB We present the results of three-dimensional global magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the Parker-shearing instability in a differentially rotating torus initially threaded by toroidal magnetic fields. An equilibrium model of a magnetized torus is adopted as an initial condition. When beta(0) = P(gas)/P(mag) similar to 1 at the initial state, magnetic flux buoyantly escapes from the disk and creates looplike structures similar to those in the solar corona. Inside the torus, the growth of nonaxisymmetric magnetorotational (or Balbus & Hawley) instability generates magnetic turbulence. Magnetic field lines are tangled on a small scale, but on a large scale they show low azimuthal wavenumber spiral structure. After several rotation periods, the system oscillates around a state with beta similar to 5. We found that magnetic pressure-dominated (beta < I) filaments are created in the torus. The volume filling factor of the region in which beta less than or equal to 0.3 is 2%-10%. Magnetic energy release in such low-P regions may lead to violent flaring activities in accretion disks and in galactic gas disks.

TI Solar causes of the long-term increase in geomagnetic activity
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
AB We analyze the causes of the century-long increase in geomagnetic activity, quantified by annual means of the aa index, using observations of interplanetary space, galactic cosmic rays, the ionosphere, and the auroral electrojet, made during the last three solar cycles. The effects of changes in ionospheric conductivity, the Earth's dipole tilt, and magnetic moment are shown to be small; only changes in near-Earth interplanetary space make a significant contribution to the long-term increase in activity. We study the effects of the interplanetary medium by applying dimensional analysis to generate the optimum solar wind-magnetosphere energy coupling function, having an unprecedentedly high correlation coefficient of 0.97. Analysis of the terms of the coupling function shows that the largest contributions to the drift in activity over solar cycles 20-22 originate from rises in the average interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) strength, solar wind concentration, and speed; average IMF orientation has grown somewhat less propitious for causing geomagnetic activity. The combination of these factors explains almost all of the 39% rise in aa observed over the last three solar cycles. Whereas the IMF strength varies approximately in phase with sunspot numbers, neither its orientation nor the solar wind density shows any coherent solar cycle variation. The solar wind speed peaks strongly in the declining phase of even-numbered cycles and can be identified as the chief cause of the phase shift between the sunspot numbers and the aa index. The rise in the IMF magnitude, the largest single contributor to the drift in geomagnetic activity, is shown to be caused by a rise in the solar coronal magnetic field, consistent with a rise in the coronal source field, modeled from photospheric observations, and an observed decay in cosmic ray fluxes.

TI Design of hybrid-photovoltaic power generator, with optimization of
   energy management
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB A methodology is developed for calculating the correct size of a photovoltaic (PV)-hybrid system and for optimizing its management. The power for the hybrid system comes from PV panels and an engine-generator - that is, a gasoline or diesel engine driving an electrical generator. The combined system is a stand-alone or autonomous system, in the sense that no third energy source is brought in to meet the load. Two parameters were used to characterize the role of the engine-generator: denoted SDM and SAR, they are, respectively, the battery charge threshold at which it is started up, and the storage capacity threshold at which it is stopped, both expressed as a percentage of the nominal battery storage capacity. The methodology developed is applied to designing a PV-hybrid system operating in Corsica, as a case study. Various sizing configurations were Simulated, and the optimal configuration that meets the autonomy constraint (no loss of load) was determined, by minimizing of the energy cost. The influence of the battery storage Capacity on the solar contribution is also studied. The smallest energy cost per kWh was obtained for a system characterized by an SDM = 30% and an SAR = 70%. A study on the effects of component lifetimes on the economics of PV-hybrid and PV stand-alone systems has shown that battery size can be reduced by a factor of two in PV-hybrid systems, as compared to PV stand-alone systems.

TI Differences in the response of carbon assimilation to summer stress
   (water deficits, high light and temperature) in four Mediterranean tree
   species
SO PHYSIOLOGIA PLANTARUM
AB Daily changes in photoprotective mechanisms were studied in sun leaves of Quercus suber L., Quercus ilex L., Olea europaea L. and Eucalyptus globulus Labill. trees during the summer in Portugal. Even though stomatal closure explained most of the diurnal variation in carbon assimilation along the summer, a decline in the photochemical yield of photosystem II (F-v'/F-m') also occurred, as a result of an excess of intercepted solar radiation when carbon assimilation is limited by stomatal closure due to high vapour pressure deficits and/or soil water deficits. These changes were accompanied by the conversion of violaxanthin to antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin which were correlated with thermal dissipation of excess photon energy. In spite of a common general response, differences between species were observed - Olea europaea, which is a slow-growing tree, had the lowest net photosynthetic rates, the highest proportion of carotenoids in relation to chlorophyll and the highest rates of de-epoxidation of violaxanthin. This enabled a large thermal dissipation of the excess intercepted radiation but led to rather small values of light utilisation for photochemistry (ca 20%). In contrast, in E. globulus, a fast-growing tree, photosynthetic rates were the highest, thermal dissipation of absorbed radiation the lowest and maximal values of light utilisation for photochemistry reached ca 50%. The two Quercus species exhibited an intermediate response. A high degree of co-ordination is apparent between stomatal behaviour, photosynthetic capacity and photoprotection mechanisms.

TI A two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation of chromospheric
   evaporation in a solar flare based on a magnetic reconnection model
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB A two-dimensional simulation of a solar flare is performed using a newly developed magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code that includes a nonlinear anisotropic heat conduction effect. The numerical simulation starts with a vertical current sheet that is line-tied at one end to a dense chromosphere. The flare energy is released by the magnetic reconnection mechanism that is stimulated initially by the resistivity perturbation in the corona. The released thermal energy is transported into the chromosphere by heat conduction and drives chromospheric evaporation. Owing to the heat conduction effect, the adiabatic slow-mode MHD shocks emanated from the neutral point are dissociated into conduction fronts and isothermal slow-mode shocks. We discovered two new features, i.e., (1) a pair of high-density humps on the evaporated plasma loops that are formed at the collision site between the reconnection flow and the evaporation flow, and (2) a loop-top dense blob behind the fast-mode MHD shock. We also derived a simple scaling law for the flare temperature described as
   T-A approximate to ((BL)-L-3/2 pi kappa(0) root 4 pi rho)(2/7) proportional to B-6/7,
   where T-A, B, rho, and kappa(0) are the temperature at the hare loop apex, the coronal magnetic field strength, the coronal density, and the heat conduction coefficient, respectively. This formula is confirmed by the numerical simulations. Temperature and derived soft X-ray distributions are similar to the cusplike structure of long-duration-event (LDE) hares observed by the soft X-ray telescope aboard Yohkoh. Density and radio free-free intensity maps show a simple loop configuration that is consistent with the observation with the Nobeyama Radio Heliograph.

TI Perpendicular diffusion and drift at intermediate cosmic-ray energies
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB We present a new derivation of perpendicular diffusion and drift coefficients, based on the Taylor-Green-Kubo equation and physical arguments as to the form of the particle velocity correlation function. In contrast to previous derivations, which are restricted to particle rigidities greater than 4 GV for typical conditions at 1 AU, our derivation is valid for intermediate-energy, as well as high-energy, cosmic rays. Our results provide a natural explanation for several hitherto puzzling observations, including (1) the form of the perpendicular diffusion coefficient derived from measurements of anomalous cosmic rays, (2) the fact that drift models often describe observations better when drifts are reduced, and (3) the ''CR-B'' relation, which associates cosmic-ray modulation with enhanced magnetic fields in merged interaction regions.

TI On the vacuum oscillation solutions of the solar neutrino problem
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We study the stability of the two-neutrino vacuum oscillation solution of the solar neutrino problem with respect to changes of the total fluxes of B-8 and Be-7 neutrinos, Phi(B) and Phi(Be). For any values of Phi(Be) from the interval 0.7 Phi(Be)(BP) less than or equal to Phi(Be) less than or equal to 1.3 Phi(Be)(BP) the solar nu(e) oscillations into an active neutrino, nu(e) <----> nu(mu(tau)), provide at 95% C.L. a description of the existing solar neutrino data for Phi(B) congruent to (0.35-3.4) Phi(B)(BP), Phi(B)(BP) and Phi(Be)(BP) being the fluxes in the solar model of Bahcall and Pinsonneault from 1992. For Phi(Be) congruent to (0.7-1.3) Phi(Be)(BP) we find also at 95% C.L. two new [one new] nu(e) <----> nu(mu(tau),) [nu(e) <----> nu(s)] oscillation solutions: (i) for Phi(B) congruent to (0.35-0.43) Phi(B)(BP) at Delta m(2) congruent to (4.7-6.5) x 10(-12) eV(2) [(4.8-6.4) x 10(-12) eV(2)] and sin(2)2 theta greater than or similar to 0.7[10.74], and (ii) for Phi(B) congruent to (0.45-0.65)Phi(B)(BP) at Delta m(2) congruent to (3.2-4.0) x 10(-11) eV(2) and sin(2)2 theta <greather than or similar to> 0.59. The physical implications of the new solutions for the future solar neutrino experiments are discussed. The data rule out at 96%-98% [98.5%] C.L. the possibility of a universal (neutrino energy independent) suppression of the different components of the solar neutrino flux, resulting from solar nu(e) oscillations or transitions into active (sterile) neutrino.

TI SIMULTANEOUS EXTREME-ULTRAVIOLET EXPLORER AND OPTICAL OBSERVATIONS OF AD
   LEONIS - EVIDENCE FOR LARGE CORONAL LOOPS AND THE NEUPERT EFFECT IN
   STELLAR FLARES
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB We report on the first simultaneous Extreme-Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) and optical observations of flares on the dMe flare star AD Leonis. The data show the following features:
   1. Two flares (one large and one of moderate size) of several hours duration were observed in the EUV wavelength range;
   2. Flare emission observed in the optical precedes the emission seen with EUVE;
   3. Several diminutions (DIMs) in the optical continuum were observed during the period of optical flare activity.
   To interpret these data, we develop a technique for deriving the coronal loop length from the observed rise and decay behavior of the EUV flare. The technique is generally applicable to existing and future coronal observations of stellar flares. We also determine the pressure, column depth, emission measure, loop cross-sectional area, and peak thermal energy during the two EUV flares, and the temperature, area coverage, and energy of the optical continuum emission.
   When the optical and coronal data are combined, we find convincing evidence of a stellar ''Neupert effect'' which is a strong signature of chromospheric evaporation models. We then argue that the known spatial correlation of white-light emission with hard X-ray emission in solar flares, and the identification of the hard X-ray emission with nonthermal bremsstrahlung produced by accelerated electrons, provides evidence that flare heating on dMe stars is produced by the same electron precipitation mechanism that is inferred to occur on the Sun.
   We provide a thorough picture of the physical processes that are operative during the largest EUV flare, compare and contrast this picture with the canonical solar flare model, and conclude that the coronal loop length may be the most important factor in determining the flare rise time and energetics.

TI REVERSIBLE PHOTOREDUCTIVE DEPOSITION AND OXIDATIVE DISSOLUTION OF COPPER
   IONS IN TITANIUM-DIOXIDE AQUEOUS SUSPENSIONS
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Particulate titanium dioxide was used to remove and concentrate Cu(II) ions in aqueous solutions through a cyclic process of photodeposition, separation, and oxidation. Illuminated, nitrogen-purged solutions containing copper sulfate, excess sodium formate (pH 3.6), and titanium dioxide formed a purple Cu-TiO2 species. Cu(II) concentrations in the supernatant were driven from 51 to less-than-or-equal-to 0.018 mug/mL. Upon purging with oxygen, this purple Cu-TiO2 system reverted back to white along with a corresponding increase in the Cu(II) supernatant concentration. The photodeposition step and the air oxidation step were utilized to demonstrate a volume reduction process. Eighty-six percent of the Cu(II) in a synthetic waste stream was concentrated to an organic-free solution having 7% of the initial volume. The remaining waste solution contained only 1% of the initial Cu(II), and in a subsequent step, the remaining formate ion was destroyed using conventional TiO2 photocatalytic oxidation. The overall process demonstrated the ability to separate copper ions from organics using only light and air. The reversible photoreduction deposition of Cu(II) from solution was observed in the pH range 1.84-6.60. The reversible photoreduction deposition of copper(II) was dependent on the organic used to scavenge holes and independent of the copper salt used.

TI CAN A CLOSURE MASS NEUTRINO HELP SOLVE THE SUPERNOVA SHOCK REHEATING
   PROBLEM
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB We point out that a nu(mu) or nu(tau) neutrino with a cosmologically significant mass (10-100 eV) and a small mixing (vacuum mixing angle theta > 10(-4)) with a light nu(e) would result in a matter-enhanced Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolf-enstein resonant transformation between these species in a region above the neutrino sphere but below the stalled shock during the reheating phase of a Type II supernova.  The neutrino heating behind the shock is due to charged-current nu(e) and nuBAR e captures.  Since the nu(mu) and nu(tau) have considerably higher average energies than do the nu(e), neutrino flavor mixing would result in higher effective nu(e) energies behind the shock and a concomitant increase in the heating rate.  Our numerical calculations suggest that this effect results in a 60% increase in the supernova explosion energy, possibly helping to solve the energy problem of delayed-mechanism supernova models.

TI Noble Metal-Free Reduced Graphene Oxide-ZnxCd1-xS Nanocomposite with
   Enhanced Solar Photocatalytic H-2-Production Performance
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Design and preparation of efficient artificial photosynthetic systems for harvesting solar energy by production of hydrogen from water splitting is of great importance from both theoretical and practical viewpoints. ZnS-based solid solutions have been fully proved to be an efficient visible-light driven photocatalysts, however, the H-2-production rate observed for these solid solutions is far from exciting and sometimes an expensive Pt cocatalyst is still needed in order to achieve higher quantum efficiency. Here, for the first time we report the high solar photocatalytic H-2-production activity over the noble metal-free reduced graphene oxide (RGO)-ZnxCd1-xS nanocomposite prepared by a facile coprecipitation-hydrothermal reduction strategy. The optimized RGO-Zn0.8Cd0.2S photocatalyst has a high H2-production rate of 1824 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) at the RGO content of 0.25 wt % and the apparent quantum efficiency of 23.4% at 420 nm (the energy conversion efficiency is ca. 0.36% at simulated one-sun (AM 1.5G) illumination). The results exhibit significantly improved photocatalytic hydrogen production by 450% compared with that of the pristine Zn0.8Cd0.2S, and are better than that of the optimized Pt-Zn0.8Cd0.2S under the same reaction conditions, showing that the RGO-Zn0.8Cd0.2S nanocomposite represents one of the most highly active metal sulfide photocatalyts in the absence of noble metal cocatalysts. This work creates a green and simple way for using RGO as a support to enhance the photocatalytic H-2-production activity of ZnxCd1-xS, and also demonstrates that RGO is a promising substitute for noble metals in photocatalytic H-2-production.

TI A Computational Investigation of Organic Dyes for Dye-Sensitized Solar
   Cells: Benchmark, Strategies, and Open Issues
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB A comprehensive theoretical study on the electronic absorption spectra of a representative group of organic dyes (L0, D4, D5, C217, and JK2) employed in dye-sensitized solar cell devices is reported. A benchmark evaluation on different time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) approaches with respect to high-level correlated coupled cluster (CC) and multireference perturbation theory (MRPT) benchmark calculations is performed in the gas phase. The benchmark results indicate that TDDFT calculations using the hybrid MPW1K and the long-range correct CAM-B3LYP functionals represent a valuable tool of comparable accuracy to that of the much more computationally demanding ab initio methods. Thus, the problem of the comparison between the calculated excitation energies and the measured absorption maximum wavelengths has been addressed employing the MPW1K functional and including the solvation effects by a polarizable continuum model. The present results show that taking into account the chemical and physical phenomena occurring in solution (i.e., protonation/deprotonation of the carboxylic function and the explicit solute solvent interactions) is of crucial importance for a meaningful comparison between the calculated and the experimental absorption spectra. Our investigation paves the way to the reliable computational design and predictive screening of organic dye sensitizers, even before their synthesis, in analogy to what has been achieved for transition-metal complexes.

TI New Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) Dyes for Efficient Dye-Sensitized Solar
   Cells
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Two novel metal-free dyes (DPP-I and DPP-II) with a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) core were synthesized for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The absorption spectra and electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of DPP-I and DPP-II were extensively investigated. Electrochemical measurement data indicate that the tuning of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels call be conveniently accomplished by alternating the pi-conjugated systems. Besides, coadsorption of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) can hinder the formation of dye aggregates and might improve electron injection yield and, thus, J(sc). This has also led to a rise in the photovoltage, which is attributed to the decrease of charge recombination. The DSSC based on dye DPP-I showed better photovoltaic performance: a maximum monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of 80%, a short-circuit photocurrent density (J(sc)) of 9.78 mA cm(-2), an open-circuit photovoltage (V(oc)) of 605 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.69, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency of 4.14% under standard global AM 1.5 solar light condition. This work suggests that the metal-free dyes based on a DPP core are promising candidates for improvement of the performance of DSSCs.

TI Energy Level Alignment in CdS Quantum Dot Sensitized Solar Cells Using
   Molecular Dipoles
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB The energy levels of CdS quantum dots (QDs) can be shifted in a systematic fashion with respect to the TiO(2) bands using molecular dipoles. Dipole moments pointing toward the QD surface shift the energy levels toward the vacuum level (a), thus enabling electron injection from excited QD states into the TiO2 conduction band at tower photon energies compared to QDs with adsorbed molecular dipotes which are pointing away from the QD surface (b). In US QD sensitized solar cells this leads to a dipole dependent shift of the photovoltage onset and the photocurrent.

TI Photoeletrocatalytic Activity of a Cu2O-Loaded Self-Organized Highly
   Oriented TiO2 Nanotube Array Electrode for 4-Chlorophenol Degradation
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Differently sized Cu2O nanoparticles have been assembled photocatalytically on the surface of self-organized highly oriented TiO2 nanotubes obtained by anodization of a Ti sheet in fluoride-containing electrolytes. X-ray diffraction analysis identifies an anatase structure and fine preferential orientation of < 101 > planes. The UV-vis absorption edge of the TiO2 nanotube arrays shift to lower energy after Cu2O loading. The composite array electrode exhibits a higher photovoltage response than the TiO2 powders directly deposited on a Ti sheet. The highest photoconversion efficiencies observed for the Cu2O-loaded electrode are 17.2% and 0.82% under UV light and visible light irradiation, respectively. Especially, the composite array electrode shows a higher efficiency than the nonloaded one for the photoelectrocatalytic decomposition of 4-chlorophenol. The improved photoeletrocatalytic activity of the TiO2/Cu2O composite array electrode is attributed to the synergistic effect of Cu2O nanoparticles and TiO2 nanotube arrays. The Cu2O nanoparticles could enhance the efficiency of photon harvesting and reduce the chances of electron-hole recombination by sending the electrons to the conduction band of TiO2 nanotubes. The accumulated electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 nanotubes would reduce oxygen to form peroxides for enhanced advanced oxidation. The byproducts; were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography.

TI A MODEL FOR SOLAR POLAR JETS
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB We propose a model for the jetting activity that is commonly observed in the Sun's corona, especially in the open-field regions of polar coronal holes. Magnetic reconnection is the process driving the jets and a relevant magnetic configuration is the well known null-point and fan-separatrix topology. The primary challenge in explaining the observations is that reconnection must occur in a short-duration energetic burst, rather than quasi-continuously as is implied by the observations of long-lived structures in coronal holes, such as polar plumes. The key idea underlying our model for jets is that reconnection is forbidden for an axisymmetrical null-point topology. Consequently, by imposing a twisting motion that maintains the axisymmetry, magnetic stress can be built up to high levels until an ideal instability breaks the symmetry and leads to an explosive release of energy via reconnection. Using three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we demonstrate that this mechanism does produce massive, high-speed jets driven by nonlinear Alfven waves. We discuss the implications of our results for observations of the solar corona.

TI Solar energy conversion toward 1 terawatt
SO MRS BULLETIN
AB The direct conversion of solar energy to electricity by photovoltaic cells or thermal energy in concentrated solar power systems is emerging as a leading contender for next-generation green power production. The photovoltaics (PV) area is rapidly evolving based on new materials and deposition approaches. At present, PV is predominately based on crystalline and polycrystalline Si and is growing at >40% per year with production rapidly approaching 3 gigawatts/year with PV installations supplying <1 % of energy used in the world. Increased cell efficiency and reduced manufacturing expenses are critical in achieving reasonable costs for PV and solarthermal. CdTe thin-film solar cells have reported a manufactured cost of $1.25/watt. There is also the promise of increased efficiency by use of multijunction cells or hybrid devices organized at the nanoscale. This could lead to conversion efficiencies of greater than 50%. Solar energy conversion increasingly represents one of the largest new businesses currently emerging in any sector of the economy.

TI Increasing solar heating of the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas,
   1979-2005: Attribution and role in the ice-albedo feedback
SO GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB [1] Over the past few decades the Arctic sea ice cover has decreased in areal extent. This has altered the solar radiation forcing on the Arctic atmosphere-ice-ocean system by decreasing the surface albedo and allowing more solar heating of the upper ocean. This study addresses how the amount of solar energy absorbed in areas of open water in the Arctic Basin has varied spatially and temporally over the past few decades. A synthetic approach was taken, combining satellite-derived ice concentrations, incident irradiances determined from reanalysis products, and field observations of ocean albedo over the Arctic Ocean and the adjacent seas. Results indicate an increase in the solar energy deposited in the upper ocean over the past few decades in 89% of the region studied. The largest increases in total yearly solar heat input, as much as 4% per year, occurred in the Chukchi Sea and adjacent areas.

TI Spectral exponents of kinetic and magnetic energy spectra in solar wind
   turbulence
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB Kinetic and magnetic energy spectra in the ecliptic plane near 1 AU are found to exhibit different power-law behaviors in the inertial range, with the magnetic spectrum often having a power-law exponent near 5/3 and the kinetic energy spectrum often having a power-law exponent near 3/2 ( the inertial range extends from approximately 5; 10-(4) 4 to 10(-1) Hz). The total energy, kinetic plus magnetic, has a power-law exponent that lies between 3/2 and 5/3, with a value near 1.6. The Alfve n ratio, the ratio of kinetic to magnetic energy, is found to be a slowly increasing function of frequency in the inertial range, increasing from roughly 0.5 to 0.9 in the frequency range from 10(-3) to 10(-1) Hz. These conclusions are based on the analysis of four distinct time intervals of solar wind magnetic field and plasma data obtained by the Wind spacecraft near the end of solar cycle 22 and at different times throughout solar cycle 23. Three 54 day intervals and one 81 day interval are used to compute power spectra in the range from 10(-5) to 1.7x10(-1) Hz. Power-law exponents are estimated from linear least-squares fits to the logarithm of the power spectral density versus the logarithm of the frequency over the frequency interval from 10(-3) to 10(-2) Hz. To prevent errors due to spectral aliasing, the last decade of the spectrum is omitted from the calculation of the power-law exponents. The results show that a measurable difference exists between the power-law exponents of velocity and magnetic field fluctuations and that this difference persists throughout the solar cycle.

TI The fabrication and characterization of dye-sensitized solar cells with
   a branched structure of ZnO nanowires
SO CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS
AB To maximize dye absorption and improve energy conversion efficiency, we adopted a branched structure for single crystalline ZnO nanowires in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The high-density branched structures of these ZnO nanowires were incorporated by a two-step seeding with zinc acetate dihydrate seeds. The ZnO nanowire DSSCs exhibited an overall efficiency of similar to 0.46%. This represented a 35% improvement compared to the ZnO nanowire DSSCs with pillar-shaped ZnO nanowires. Our current density-voltage (J-V) characterizations suggest that the current densities and power conversion efficiencies were improved by increasing the surface area with these branched structures of ZnO nanowires in DSSCs.

TI Local and global variations of the fine-structure constant
SO MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
AB Using the Bekenstein-Sandvik-Barrow-Magueijo (BSBM) varying-alpha theory, with dark matter dominated by magnetic energy, and the spherical collapse model for cosmological structure formation, we have studied the effects of the dark-energy equation of state and the coupling of to the matter fields on the space and time evolution of. We have compared its evolution inside virialized overdensities with that in the cosmological background, using the standard (Lambda = 0) cold dark matter (CDM) model of structure formation and the dark-energy modification, wCDM. We find that, independently of the model of structure formation one considers, there is always a difference between the value of in an overdensity and in the background. In a standard CDM (SCDM) model, this difference is the same, independent of the virialization redshift of the overdense region. In the case of a dark-energy CDM (wCDM) model, especially at low redshifts, the difference depends on the time when virialization occurs and the equation of state of the dark energy. At high redshifts, when the wCDM model becomes asymptotically equivalent to the SCDM one, the difference is constant. At low redshifts, when dark energy starts to dominate the cosmological expansion, the difference between in a cluster and in the background grows. The inclusion of the effects of inhomogeneity leads naturally to no observable local time variations of on Earth and in our Galaxy even though time variations can be significant on quasar scales. The inclusion of the effects of inhomogeneous cosmological evolution are necessary if terrestrial and solar-system bounds on the time variation of the fine-structure 'constant' are to be correctly compared with extragalactic data.

AB Transition metal complexes using polypyridine ligands are finding increasing use in the dye sensitized solar cells. To improve further the efficiency of this cell, an enhanced spectral response of the sensitizer in the lower energies is required. In this paper we review our effort in the molecular design of the ruthenium polypyridyl complexes for nanocrystalline TiO2-based solar cells. The poor cell efficiency in Ru(4,4'-dicarboxy-2,2'-biquinoline)(2)(NCS)(2)/TiO2 system may be ascribed to the low excited-state oxidation potential, which plays a crucial role in the electron-transfer process. Ru(2-(2-(4-carboxypyridyl))-4-carboxyquinoline)(2)(NCS())2, when anchored to nanocrystalline TiO2 films, achieves efficient sensitization over the whole visible range extending up to 900 nm, yielding incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of 55%. The low cell efficiency of Ru(4-4-dicarboxy-2,2-bypyridine)(2)(ethyl-2-cyano-3,3-dimercaptoacrylate) may be due to slow regeneration of the dye by electron donation from iodide following charge injection into the TiO2. Tuning of HOMO and LUMO energy level show that an efficient sensitizer should possess ground-state and excited-state redox potentials of 0.5 and -0.8 V vs. SCE, respectively. Transient absorption studies of Ru phenanthroline complexes show that the efficiency of electron injection is strongly affected by the number of carboxyl groups of the sensitizing dye. The beta-diketonate complex [Ru(4-4'-dicarboxy-2,2'-bypyridine)2(acetylacetonato)]Cl, when anchored to nanocrystalline TiO2 films, achieves very efficient sensitization across the entire visible region, yielding 60% IPCE. A new series of panchromatic sensitizers of Ru(tricarboxyterpyridine)(beta-diketonato)(NCS) type have been developed. Ru(4,4',4"-tricarboxy-2,2: 6',2"-terpyridine)(1,1,1-trifluoropentane-2,4-dionato)(NCS) achieved an efficient sensitization of nanocrystalline, TiO2 solar cells over the whole visible range extending into near IR region and displaying a maximum around 600 nm, where IPCE approaches a high value of 70%.

TI Consistency of MODIS surface bidirectional reflectance distribution
   function and albedo retrievals: 2. Validation
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
AB [1] The evaluation of the first available satellite-based global albedo product at 1-km resolution is essential for its application in climate studies. We evaluate the accuracy of the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) albedo product using available field measurements at Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) and Cloud and Radiation Testbed-Southern Great Plains (CART/SGP) stations and examine the consistency between the MODIS surface albedos and the Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) top-of-the-atmosphere albedos as well as historical global albedos from advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) and Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) observations. A comparison with the field measurements shows that the MODIS surface albedo generally meets an absolute accuracy requirement of 0.02 for our study sites during April-September 2001, with the root mean square errors less than 0.018. Larger differences appear in the winter season probably due to the increased heterogeneity of surface reflectivity in the presence of snow. To examine the effect of spatial heterogeneity on the validation of the MODIS albedos using fine resolution field measurements, we derive an intermediate albedo product from four Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images at 30-m spatial resolution as a surrogate for the distributed field measurements. The surface albedo is relatively homogeneous over the study stations in growing seasons, and therefore the validation during April-September is supported. A case study over three SURFRAD stations reveals that the MODIS bidirectional reflectance distribution function model is able to capture the solar zenith angle dependence of surface albedo as shown by the field measurements. We also find that the MODIS surface shortwave albedo is consistent with the contemporary and collocated CERES top-of atmosphere albedos derived directly from broadband observations. The MODIS albedo is also well correlated with historical surface albedos derived from AVHRR and ERBE observations, and a high bias of 0.016 and a low bias of 0.034 compared to those of the latter albedos are reasonable considering the differences in instruments and retrieval algorithms as well as environmental changes.

TI Efficiencies of electron injection from excited sensitizer dyes to
   nanocrystalline ZnO films as studied by near-IR optical absorption of
   injected electrons
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B
AB Near-IR absorption spectra of electrons injected from excited sensitizer dyes to nanocrystalline ZnO films have been studied. The absorption steeply increases with increasing wavelength and can be assigned to the optical transition of conducting electrons to higher energy levels of the conduction band. From the measurements in various sensitizer dyes, the relative efficiencies of the electron injection can be obtained as a function of the free energy change (DeltaG) for the electron injection process. Around DeltaG = 0 eV, the efficiencies increase gradually with increasing -DeltaG and they are constant at negative DeltaG. We succeeded in explaining the tendency by considering the site heterogeneity of the surface. The relation between the injection efficiencies and the solar cell performance will also be discussed.

TI Examination of band bending at buckminsterfullerene (C-60)/metal

SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB This study addresses the question of band bending at the C-60/metal interface. The change in the energy of the vacuum level upon the deposition of C-60 on various metal substrates (Au, Cu, and Ag) was examined by the Kelvin probe method under ultrahigh vacuum as a function of C-60 thickness d. We observed (1) an abrupt shift of the energy of the vacuum level relative to the Fermi level of the metal substrate epsilon(vac)(F) at dless than or equal to1 nm, to a uniform value of about 4.65 eV at all of the interfaces examined and (2) a slower shift with further deposition of C-60, which stopped at dsimilar to500 nm at another common value. These abrupt and gradual shifts can be ascribed to the formation of an interfacial dipole layer and to band bending leading to Fermi level alignment, respectively. The value of epsilon(vac)(F) for the thick region is ascribed to the bulk work function of the specific specimen studied, and it is noted that the values reported for a few monolayers in the literature should not actually be regarded as the bulk work function. These results clearly demonstrate the necessity of detailed measurements of epsilon(vac)(F) up to a large thickness of the organic film and of using various metal substrates to determine the bulk work function. The convergence of epsilon(vac)(F) to a common value at a large thickness indicates the existence of remaining impurity. Its concentration was estimated and the effect of purification by sublimation was examined. We note that the bulk work functions obtained as the convergent values in such measurements are characteristic of specific specimens and may still not correspond to the value of the really intrinsic material.

TI Effects of silver particles on the photovoltaic properties of
   dye-sensitized TiO2 thin films
SO SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS
AB To evaluate the possibility of using the plasmon resonance effect to enhance the efficiency of photochemical cells, cis-(SCN)(2) Bis(2,2'-bipyridyl-4,4'-dicarboxylate) ruthenium (II) dye-sensitized cells were used to measure the photoresponse of TiO2 him electrodes before and after deposition of Ag particles. The deposited Ag particles created a him with Ag islands. We found that the photoresponse in the visible region increased as the mass-equivalent Ag-island film thickness, t(Ag), increased to 3.3 nm, but decreased when t(Ag) was further increased to 6 nm. On the other hand, compared with bare TiO2 films, the photoresponse in the UV region decreased for any level of Ag islands. These results suggest that under proper conditions, enhancement of the optical absorption of the dye by the Ag plasmon resonance effect contributes to the photocurrent, and indicates the possibility of improving the energy conversion efficiency of photoelectrochemical cells with Ag-island films.

TI Charge states of solar energetic particles using the geomagnetic cutoff
   technique: SAMPEX measurements in the 6 November 1997 solar particle
   event
SO GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB We report on the ionization states of similar to 0.5-50 MeV/nucleon ions in the 6 November 1997 solar particle event using instrumentation on the SAMPEX satellite and the geomagnetic cutoff technique. Using the geomagnetic cutoffs of similar to 10 MeV He-4 and similar to 20 MeV protons, we infer the ionization states of similar to 0.5-50 MeV/nucleon C-Fe by measuring their latitude distributions. The geomagnetic cutoffs method extends the measurement of ionization states beyond 10 MeV/nucleon, where charge state information is inaccessible with present electrostatic deflection techniques. In contrast to an increase of the Fe charge state observed above similar to 20 MeV/nucleon in events in late 1992, we find in the 6 November 1997 event that Si & Fe charge states increased dramatically across 0.5-50 MeV/nucleon. While the origin of this newly discovered energy dependence is unknown, such significant event to event variations of solar particle charge states should be considered in models of acceleration and transport processes.

TI Particle heating by Alfvenic turbulence in hot accretion flows
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB Recent work on Alfvenic turbulence by Goldreich & Sridhar (GS) suggests that the energy cascades almost entirely perpendicular to the local magnetic field. As a result, the cyclotron resonance is unimportant in dissipating the turbulent energy. Motivated by the GS cascade, we calculate the linear collisionless dissipation of Alfven waves with frequencies much less than the proton cyclotron frequency, but with perpendicular wavelengths of order the Larmor radius of thermal protons. In plasmas appropriate to hot accretion flows (proton temperature much greater than electron temperature), the dissipated Alfven wave energy primarily heats the protons. For a plasma with beta less than or similar to 5, however, where B is the ratio of the gas pressure to the magnetic pressure, the MHD assumptions utilized in the GS analysis break down before most of the energy in Alfven waves is dissipated; how the cascade then proceeds is unclear. Hot accretion flows, such as advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs), are expected to contain significant levels of MHD turbulence. This work suggests that, for beta greater than or similar to 5, the Alfvenic component of such turbulence primarily heats the protons. Significant proton heating is required for the viability of ADAF models. We contrast our results on particle heating in ADAFs with recent work by Bisnovatyi-Kogan & Lovelace.

TI Disruption of kilometre-sized asteroids by energetic collisions
SO NATURE
AB Recent numerical studies(1-5) suggest that 'rubble-pile' asteroids (gravitationally bound aggregates of collisional debris) are common in the Solar System, and that self-gravitation may equal or exceed material cohesion for planetary bodies as small as several hundred metres. Because analytical scaling relations for impact cratering and disruption(6-8) do not extend to this size regime, where gravity and material strength are both important, detailed simulations are needed to predict how small asteroids evolve through impact, and also to ascertain whether powerful explosions offer a viable defence against bodies headed for a collision with Earth. Here we present simulations, using a smooth-particle hydrodynamics code(9), of energetic impacts into small planetary bodies with internal structure ranging from solid rock to porous aggregate. We find that the outcome of a collision is very sensitive to the configuration of pre-existing fractures and voids in the target. A porous asteroid (or one with deep regolith) damps the propagation of the shock wave from the impactor, sheltering the most distant regions, while greatly enhancing the local deposition of energy. Multiple-component asteroids (such as contact binaries) are also protected, because the shock wave cannot traverse the discontinuity between the components. We conclude that the first impact to significantly fragment an asteroid may determine its subsequent collisional evolution, and that internal structure will greatly influence attempts to disrupt or deflect an asteroid or comet headed towards Earth.

TI X-ray network flares of the quiet sun
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB Temporal variations in the soft X-ray (SXR) emission and the radio emission above the solar magnetic network of the quiet corona are investigated using Yohkoh SXR images with deep exposure and VLA observations in the centimeter radio range. The SXR data show several brightenings, with an extrapolated occurrence probability of one brightening per 3 seconds on the total solar surface. During the roughly 10 minutes of enhanced flux, total radiative losses of the observed plasma are around 10(25) ergs per event. These events are more than an order of magnitude smaller than previously reported X-ray bright points or active region transient brightenings. For all of the four SXR events with simultaneous radio observations, a corresponding radio source correlating in space and time can be found. There are several similarities between solar flares and the SXR/radio events presented in this paper. (1) Variations in temperature and emission measure during the SXR enhancements are consistent with evaporation of cooler material from the transition region and the chromosphere. (2) The ratio of the total energies radiated in SXR and radio frequencies is similar to that observed in flares. (3) At least one radio event shows a degree of polarization as high as 35%. (4) In three out of four substructures the centimeter radio emission peaks several tens of seconds earlier than in the SXR emission. (5) The associated radio emission tends to be more structured and to have faster rise times. These events thus appear to be flare-like and are called network flares.

TI Variability of CGRO/EGRET gamma-ray sources
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB We have developed a method for quantifying the flux variability of EGRET high-energy gamma-ray sources. We apply this method to all sources in the Second EGRET Catalog except for the one solar flare. Allowing for a small systematic uncertainty, the phase-averaged flux densities of the pulsars are consistent with being nonvariable. Many identified active galactic nuclei are variable, as expected, and it is likely that the apparent nonvariability of some identified active galactic nuclei results from decreased sensitivity to variability at low fluxes and low latitudes. Populations of both variable and nonvariable unidentified sources are found to be in excess at low Galactic latitudes. While low-flux, nonvariable, unidentified sources could result from errors in the Galactic diffuse model, some higher flux, nonvariable, unidentified sources are likely to be Galactic pulsars. The excess of variable, unidentified sources at low latitudes suggests that either pulsars can produce variable gamma rays under special circumstances, or that a new class of Galactic gamma-ray sources exists.

TI Ambient solar radiation-induced photodamage in marine bacterioplankton
SO PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY
AB There has been much recent concern about the effects of increased UV radiation at certain locations on the earth's surface. There have been extensive studies of ultraviolet radiation effects on phytoplankton and primary production, yet the effects of UVB upon bacterioplankton have been largely overlooked, Bacteria play a central role in the cycling of nutrients and energy flow to higher trophic levels, serving as both mineralizers and secondary producers that are consumed by higher organisms, We have begun to investigate the induction of DNA photodamage by UVB in marine planktonic communities using a highly specific radioimmunoassay to measure cyclobutane pyrimidine diners in samples collected from the northern Gulf of Mexico. DNA damage in the bacterioplankton size-fraction (<0.8 mu m) was greater than in the larger eukaryotic size fraction (>0.8 mu m <120 mu m) in 9 of 10 samples, Diel patterns of dimer accumulation and repair were observed in surface waters over a 48 h period in the bacterioplankton size fraction and in the larger eukaryotic plankton size fraction, Depth profiles of DNA damage in the bacterioplankton size fraction appear to be dependent on surface water mixing, Damage was greatest in surface waters, decreased with depth and could be detected to 10 m in calm seas, No net accumulation of damage was observed in moderate seas, even at the surface, Solar radiation was found to inhibit significantly both H-3-thymidine and C-14-leucine incorporation. Ultraviolet B was responsible for approximately bah of the total inhibition of H-3-thymidine incorporation, UVA contributing the other half of the inhibition, The vast majority of C-14-leucine incorporation inhibition was due to UVB, suggesting that protein synthesis is less affected by UVA. The results demonstrate that direct measures of DNA damage can be made of indigenous planktonic communities and that bacterioplankton are highly susceptible to UVB damage and may serve as a more sensitive indicator of UVR stress than other microorganisms.

TI A comprehensive characterization of the interfaces in Mo/CIS/CdS/ZnO
   solar cell structures
SO SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS
AB The alignment of energy bands in a Mo/CIS/CdS/ZnO solar cell structure is presented as derived from individual measurements on the different interfaces. Special attention is paid to the surface chemistry of the molybdenum coated substrate. In this study we have performed in situ analyses on polycrystalline thin films starting with the molybdenum coated soda lime glass. The different films have been deposited sequentially under ultra high vacuum conditions and have been analyzed with photoelectron spectroscopy techniques. We have found that the Mo surface is significantly oxidized. Air annealing at 200 degrees C leads to a diffusion of sodium through the Mo layer. Mo-O compounds are present and Mo-Se compounds are formed during the evolution of the Mo-CIS interface. Band lineups have been determined for the CIS/CdS/ZnO interfaces of the solar cell structure. We have found no indication for band discontinuities deteriorating the solar cell device performance.

TI HIGH-ENERGY PARTICLES IN SOLAR-FLARES
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS
AB Accelerated particles appear to coexist inseparably with most forms of energy release in solar flares and coronal mass ejections. We identify at least five different populations of high-energy electrons and ions. High-energy particles, accelerated efficiently in the flare in great numbers, transport a large fraction of the flare energy to other sites. This behavior makes them an integral part of the flare process. Much new data has come from two spacecraft launched in 1991: the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory and Yohkoh. This review concentrates on particles in flares, mainly using X-ray and gamma-ray data rather than measurements of ''escaping'' particles observed in interplanetary space.

TI THE POSSIBLE ROLE OF MHD WAVES IN HEATING THE SOLAR CORONA
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB The possible role of waves in the heating of the solar corona has been investigated. A general dispersion relation has been derived for waves propagating in a homogeneous plasma subject to dissipation by viscosity and thermal conduction. The dissipation mechanisms have been incorporated self-consistently into the equations, and no assumptions about the strength of the damping have been made. Solutions of the sixth-order dispersion relation provide information on how the damping of both slow and fast mode waves depends upon the plasma density, temperature, field strength, and angle of propagation relative to the background magnetic field. We provide a detailed comparison to the standard approach, which is to solve for the wave quantities in the absence of dissipation and then to use these quantities in expressions for the heating due to viscosity and thermal conduction.
   It is possible that slow mode energy fluxes derived from Doppler line shift measurements in the chromosphere and transition region have been greatly underestimated, leading to the premature dismissal of slow mode waves in the literature. Specifically, Doppler line shift measurements do not account for unresolved, small-scale motions. Line broadening measurements, which do provide a way of estimating the amplitudes of small-scale motions, indicate that slow mode energy fluxes may be sufficient to meet the energy budget requirements of quiet regions. In fact, slow mode waves may also contribute to the heating in active regions, particularly if one considers that they may be generated in the corona by turbulent motions at magnetic reconnection sites. Calculations of wave damping rates from the dispersion relation for values representative of a quiet solar region indicate that slow mode waves with periods less than 300 s can damp sufficiently rapidly that they could dissipate enough energy to balance radiative losses. For active region conditions, slow mode waves with periods less than 100 s may provide adequate heating.
   Fast mode waves may also play an important role in coronal heating. Because fast mode wave group velocities are roughly an order of magnitude greater than those of slow mode waves, fast mode wave fluxes from below the corona can meet energy budget requirements in both quiet regions and active regions. For quiet region conditions, it was found that fast mode waves with periods less than about 75 s may damp at rates great enough to balance radiative losses. The damping of fast mode waves is inhibited by strong magnetic fields, and we find that only those waves with very high frequencies (tau < 1 s) can damp sufficiently rapidly to balance radiative losses in active regions. Although these frequencies are very high, there is no observational evidence that rules out their existence, and they may be generated both below the corona and at magnetic reconnection sites in the corona.

Measurements were initiated a few days later, including solar energy inputs to the atmosphere and vertical profiles of temperature, important minor gas species, and wind fields. The orbital parameters, combined with the sensor measurements characteristics, yield a measurement pattern that produces near global coverage with a duty cycle that periodically favors the Northern or the Southern hemispheres.

TI Solar cells with one-day energy payback for the factories of the future
SO ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB Scalability is a requirement before any new energy source can be expected to house a possible solution to the challenge that mankind's increasing energy demand presents. No renewable energy source is as abundant as the Sun and yet efficient and low-cost conversion of solar energy still has not been developed. We approach the challenge by firstly taking a technology that efficiently addresses the need for daily production of 1 GW(p) on a global level, which does not employ elements with critically low abundance and has a low thermal budget. We then applied life cycle assessment methodologies to direct research and developed such technology in the form of a polymer solar cell that presents a significant improvement in energy payback time (EPBT) and found that very short energy payback times on the order of one day are possible, thus potentially presenting a solution to the current energy gap of > 14 TW by year 2050.

TI Energy Transfer from Individual Semiconductor Nanocrystals to Graphene
SO ACS NANO
AB Energy transfer from photoexcited zero-dimensional systems to metallic systems plays a prominent role in modern day materials science. A situation of particular interest concerns the interaction between a photoexcited dipole and an atomically thin metal. The recent discovery of graphene layers permits investigation of this phenomenon. Here we report a study of fluorescence from individual CdSe/ZnS nanocrystals in contact with single- and few-layer graphene sheets. The rate of energy transfer is determined from the strong quenching of the nanocrystal fluorescence. For single-layer graphene, we find a rate of similar to 4 ns(-1), in agreement with a model based on the dipole approximation and a tight-binding description of graphene. This rate increases significantly with the number of graphene layers, before approaching the bulk limit. Our study quantifies energy transfer to and fluorescence quenching by graphene, critical properties for novel applications in photovoltaic devices and as a molecular ruler.

TI Porous photocatalysts for advanced water purifications
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY
AB Semiconductor-mediated heterogeneous photocatalysis is a promising technology for water purifications without generating harmful by-products. The photocatalyst with designed physicochemical properties is the key in the process. Utilization of particulate photocatalysts will create some technological problems, such as difficulty in recycling and management. Thus, cost-effective methods for mass production of highly active photocatalysts that can be operated in an industrial photoreactor with less energy consumption and harmless subsequent consequences are increasingly attracting research attention. Photocatalysts with controllable morphologies at a wide range of scales shall be taken into account in designing the photocatalyst. This review article features recent research progress towards the design and preparation of porous photocatalysts with prescribed structural, compositional, and morphological properties suitable for use in a photocatalytic reactor for water treatment via advanced oxidation processes. With a brief introduction of the important features of a porous photocatalyst in industrial reactors, the review highlights various synthetic strategies for fabricating porous photocatalysts with well-defined microscopic morphologies and nano/meso-scopic active nanobuilding blocks. The synthesis-component-structure-property relationship working in photocatalyst design is discussed. Immobilization of photocatalysts on different porous substrates is highlighted. The perspectives of designing photocatalysts for industrial applications are suggested.

TI Thiophene/Phenylene/Thiophene-Based Low-Bandgap Conjugated Polymers for
   Efficient Near-Infrared Photovoltaic Applications
SO CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS
AB We have prepared thiophene/phenylene/thiophene (TPT)-based low bandgap conjugated polymers exhibiting tunable energy levels and investigated their application in solar cells. By incorporating various electron-withdrawing comonomers through Stille coupling reactions, we obtained TPT-based donor/acceptor copolymers having bandgaps ranging from 1.0 to 1.8 eV. We compared the absorption spectra, electrochemistry, field effect hole mobility, and photovoltaic properties of these low bandgap TPT derivatives with those of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). The absorption coefficients of the thin films fell in the range from 0.77 x 10(5) to 1.4 x 10(5) cm(-1). These materials displayed sufficiently high hole mobilities (> 10(-3) cm(2) V(-1) s(-1)) for efficient charge extraction and good fill-factors for organic photovoltaic applications. Electrochemical studies indicated desirable HOMO/LUMO levels, with a good correlation between the HOMO energy levels and the open circuit voltage (V(oc)) when the polymers were blended with fullerene derivative as an electron acceptor. Power conversion efficiencies of up to 4.3% were achieved under AM 1.5G simulated solar light (100 mW cm(-2)). Our findings suggest that TPT derivatives presenting suitable electron-withdrawing groups are promising photovoltaic materials.

TI THE LAST GASP OF GAS GIANT PLANET FORMATION: A SPITZER STUDY OF THE 5
   Myr OLD CLUSTER NGC 2362
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB Expanding upon the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) survey from Dahm & Hillenbrand, we describe Spitzer IRAC and Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer observations of the populous, 5 Myr old open cluster NGC 2362. We analyze the mid-IR colors of cluster members and compared their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to star+circumstellar disk models to constrain the disk morphologies and evolutionary states. Early/intermediate-type confirmed/candidate cluster members either have photospheric mid-IR emission or weak, optically thin IR excess emission at lambda >= 24 mu m consistent with debris disks. Few late-type, solar/subsolar-mass stars have primordial disks. The disk population around late-type stars is dominated by disks with inner holes (canonical "transition disks") and "homologously depleted" disks. Both types of disks represent an intermediate stage between primordial disks and debris disks. Thus, in agreement with previous results, we find that multiple paths for the primordial-to-debris disk transition exist. Because these "evolved primordial disks" greatly outnumber primordial disks, our results undermine standard arguments in favor of a less than or similar to 10(5) yr timescale for the transition based on data from Taurus-Auriga. Because the typical transition timescale is far longer than 10(5) yr, these data also appear to rule out standard ultraviolet photoevaporation scenarios as the primary mechanism to explain the transition. Combining our data with other Spitzer surveys, we investigate the evolution of debris disks around high/intermediate-mass stars and investigate timescales for giant planet formation. Consistent with Currie et al., the luminosity of 24 mu m emission in debris disks due to planet formation peaks at approximate to 10-20 Myr. If the gas and dust in disks evolve on similar timescales, the formation timescale for gas giant planets surrounding early-type, high/intermediate-mass (greater than or similar to 1.4 M-circle dot) stars is likely 1-5 Myr. Most solar/subsolar-mass stars detected by Spitzer have SEDs that indicate their disks may be actively leaving the primordial disk phase. Thus, gas giant planet formation may also occur by similar to 5 Myr around solar/subsolar-mass stars as well.

SO ELECTROCHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS
AB Formation of US quantum dots (Q dots) on the vertically aligned ZnO nanorods electrode was carried out by chemical bath deposition. The diameter and thickness of ZnO nanorods are similar to 100-150 nm and similar to 1.6 mu m, respectively, and CdS Q dots on ZnO nanorods have a diameter of smaller than 15 nm. In application of the Q dots-sensitized solar cells, composite film exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 0.54% under air mass 1.5 condition (80 mW/cm(2)), and incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency showed 18.6%.

TI Vitamin D and skin physiology: A D-lightful story

   D-Related Disorders
CY DEC 04-05, 2006
CL Washington, DC

AB Throughout evolution, exposure to sunlight and the photosynthesis of vitamin D-3 in the skin has been critically important for the evolution of land vertebrates. During exposure to sunlight, the solar UVB photons with energies 290-315 nm are absorbed by 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin and converted to previtamin D-3. Previtamin D-3 undergoes a rapid transformation within the plasma membrane to vitamin D-3. Excessive exposure to sunlight will not result in vitamin D intoxication because both previtamin D-3 and vitamin D-3 are photolyzed to several noncalcemic photoproducts. During the winter at latitudes above similar to 35 degrees, there is minimal, if any, previtamin D3 production in the skin. Altitude also has a significant effect on vitamin D-3 production. At 27 degrees N in November, very little (similar to 0.5%) previtamin D-3 synthesis was detected in Agra (169 in) and Katmandu (1400 in). There was an similar to 2- and 4-fold increase in previtamin D-3 production at similar to 3400 m and at Everest base camp (5300 in), respectively. Increased skin pigmentation, application of a sunscreen, aging, and clothing have a dramatic effect on previtamin D-3 production in the skin. It is estimated that exposure in a bathing suit to 1 minimal erythemal dose (MED) is equivalent to ingesting between 10,000 and 25,000 IU of vitamin D-2. The importance of sunlight for providing most humans with their vitamin D requirement is well documented by the seasonal variation in circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. Vitamin D deficiency [i.e., 25(OH)D < 20 ng/ml] is common in both children and adults worldwide. Exposure to lamps that produce UVB radiation is an excellent source for producing vitamin D-3 in the skin and is especially efficacious in patients with fat malabsorption syndromes. The major cause of vitamin D deficiency globally is an underappreciation of sunlight's role in providing humans with their vitamin D-3 requirement. Very few foods naturally contain vitamin D, and those that do have a very variable vitamin D content. Recently it was observed that wild caught salmon had between 75% and 90% more vitamin D-3 compared with farmed salmon. The associations regarding increased risk of common deadly cancers, autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, and cardiovascular disease with living at higher latitudes and being prone to vitamin D deficiency should alert all health care professionals about the importance of vitamin D for overall health and well being.

TI A log N-HI=22.6 damped Ly alpha absorber in a dark gamma-ray burst: The
   environment of GRB 050401
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB The optical afterglow spectrum of GRB 050401 (at z = 2.8992 +/- 0.0004) shows the presence of a damped Ly alpha absorber (DLA), with log N-Hi 22.6 +/- 0.3. This is the highest column density ever observed in a DLA and is about 5 times larger than the strongest DLA detected so far in any QSO spectrum. From the optical spectrum, we also find a very large Zn column density, implying an abundance of [Zn/H] = -1.0 +/- 0.4. These large columns are supported by the early X-ray spectrum from Swift XRT, which shows a column density (in excess of Galactic) of log N-H = 22.21(-0.08)(+0.06) assuming solar abundances (at z = 2.9). The comparison of this X-ray column density, which is dominated by absorption due to alpha-chain elements, and the H I column density derived from the Ly alpha absorption line allows us to derive a metallicity for the absorbing matter of [alpha/H] = -0.4 +/- 0.3. The optical spectrum is reddened and can be well reproduced with a power law with SMC extinction, where A(V) = 0.62 +/- 0.06. But the total optical extinction can also be constrained independent of the shape of the extinction curve: from the optical to X-ray spectral energy distribution, we find 0.5 less than or similar to A(V) less than or similar to 4.5. However, even this upper limit, independent of the shape of the extinction curve, is still well below the dust column that is inferred from the X-ray column density, i.e., A(V) = 9.1(-1.5)(+1.4). This discrepancy might be explained by a small dust content with high metallicity (low dust-to-metals ratio). "Gray" extinction cannot explain the discrepancy, since we are comparing the metallicity to a measurement of the total extinction (without reference to the reddening). Little dust with high metallicity may be produced by sublimation of dust grains or may naturally exist in systems younger than a few hundred megayears.

TI Preparation of ultrafine chalcopyrite nanoparticles via the
   photochemical decomposition of molecular single-source precursors
SO NANO LETTERS
AB The synthesis and characterization of ultrafine CuInS2 nanoparticles are described. Ultraviolet irradiation was used to decompose a molecular single source precursor, yielding organic soluble similar to 2 nm sized nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution. UV-vis absorption, H-1 and P-31 {H-1} NMR, and fluorescence spectroscopies and mass spectrometry were used to characterize decomposition of the precursors and nanoparticle formation. The nanoparticles were characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron diffraction, inductively coupled plasma analysis, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy. They have a wurzite-type crystal structure with a copper-rich composition. The hypsochromic shift in their emission band due to quantum confinement effects is consistent with the size of the nanocrystals indicated in the HRTEM and XRD analyses.

TI Voltage fluctuations on distribution level introduced by photovoltaic
   systems
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENERGY CONVERSION
AB In moderate climates, short fluctuations in solar irradiance and their impact on the distribution grid will become an important issue with regard to the future large-scale application of embedded photovoltaic systems. Several related studies from the past are recalled. The approach that is presented here applies a localized spectral analysis to the solar irradiance and derived quantities in order to determine the power content of fluctuations, depending on their characteristic persistence. Pseudorandom time series of solar irradiance, based on measured values of the instantaneous clearness index, are applied as input data. Power-flow calculations are carried out in order to assess the impact of fluctuating solar irradiance on the grid voltage. The "fluctuation power index" is defined as a measure for the mean-square value of fluctuations of a specific persistence. A typical scenario is simulated, and the results are interpreted.

TI Blue copper model complexes with distorted tetragonal geometry acting as
   effective electron-transfer mediators in dye-sensitized solar cells
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB The electron self-exchange rate constants of blue copper model complexes, [(-)-sparteine-N,N'](maleonitriledithiolato-S,S')copper ([Cu(SP)(mmt)])(0/-), bis(2,9-dimethy-1,10-phenanthroline)copper ([Cu(dMP)(2)](2+/+)), and bis(1,10-phenanthroline)copper ([Cu(dmp)(2)](2+/+)) have been determined from the rate constants of electron transfer from a homologous series of ferrocene derivatives to the copper(II) complexes in light of the Marcus theory of electron transfer. The resulting electron self-exchange rate constant increases in the order: [Cu(phen)(2)](2+/+) < [Cu(Sp)(mmt)](0/-) < [Cu(dMP)(2)](2+/+), in agreement with the order of the smaller structural change between the copper(II) and copper(I) complexes due to the distorted tetragonal geometry. The dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) were constructed using the copper complexes as redox couples to compare the photoelectrochemical responses with those using the conventional I-3(-)/I- couple. The light energy conversion efficiency (eta) values under illumination of simulated solar light irradiation (100 mW/cm(2)) of DSSCs using [Cu(phen)(2)](2+/+), [Cu(dMP)(2)](2+/+), and [Cu(SP)(mmt)](0/-) were recorded as 0.1%, 1.4%, and 1.3%, respectively. The maximum eta value (2.2%) was obtained for a DSSC using the [Cu(dMP)(2)](2+/+) redox couple under the light irradiation of 20 mW/cm(2) intensity, where a higher open-circuit voltage of the cell was attained as compared to that of the conventional I-3(-)/I- couple.

TI Seasonality of water and heat fluxes over a tropical forest in eastern
   Amazonia
SO ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB We used the eddy covariance technique from July 2000 to July 2001 to measure the fluxes of sensible heat, water vapor, and CO, between an old-growth tropical forest in eastern Amazonia and the atmosphere. Precipitation varied seasonally, with a wet season from mid-December 2000 to July 2001 characterized by successive rainy days, wet soil, and,,relative to the dry season, cooler temperatures, greater cloudiness, and reduced incoming solar and net radiation. Average evapotranspiration decreased from 3.96 +/- 0.65 mm/d during the dry season to 3.18 +/- 0.76 mm/d during the wet season, in parallel with decreasing radiation and decreasing water vapor deficit. The average Bowen ratio was 0.17 +/- 0.10, indicating that most of the incoming radiation was used for evaporation. The Bowen ratio was relatively low during the early wet season (December-March), as a result of increased evaporative fraction and reduced sensible heat flux. The seasonal decline in Bowen ratio and increase in evaporative fraction coincided with an increase in ecosystem CO2 assimilation capacity, which we attribute to the growth of new leaves. The evaporative fraction did not decline as the dry season progressed, implying that the forest did not become drought stressed. The roots extracted water throughout the top 250 cm of soil, and water redistribution, possibly by hydraulic lift, partially recharged the shallow soil during dry season nights. The lack of drought stress during the dry season was likely a consequence of deep rooting, and possibly vertical water movement, which allowed the trees to maintain access to soil water year round.

TI ILCT: Recovering photospheric velocities from magnetograms by combining
   the induction equation with local correlation tracking
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB We present three methods for deriving the velocity field in magnetized regions of the Sun's photosphere. As a preliminary step, we introduce a Fourier-based local correlation tracking (LCT) routine that we term "FLCT.'' By explicitly employing the observation made by Demoulin & Berger, that results determined by LCT applied to magnetograms involve a combination of all components of the velocity and magnetic fields, we show that a three-component velocity field can be derived, in a method we term algebraic decomposition, or ADC. Finally, we introduce ILCT, a method that enforces consistency between the normal component of the induction equation and results obtained from LCT. When used with photospheric vector magnetograms, ILCT determines a three-component photospheric velocity field suitable for use with time sequences of such magnetograms to drive boundary conditions for MHD simulations of the solar corona. We present results from these methods applied to vector magnetograms of NOAA AR 8210 on 1998 May 1.

TI Magnetic reconnection and mass acceleration in flare-coronal mass
   ejection events
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB An observational relationship has been well established among magnetic reconnection, high-energy flare emissions and the rising motion of erupting flux ropes. In this paper, we verify that the rate of magnetic reconnection in the low corona is temporally correlated with the evolution of flare nonthermal emissions in hard X-rays and microwaves, all reaching their peak values during the rising phase of the soft X-ray emission. In addition, however, our new observations reveal a temporal correlation between the magnetic reconnection rate and the directly observed acceleration of the accompanying coronal mass ejection (CME) and filament in the low corona, thus establishing a correlation with the rising flux rope. These results are obtained by examining two well-observed two-ribbon flare events, for which we have good measurements of the rise motion of filament eruption and CMEs associated with the flares. By measuring the magnetic flux swept through by flare ribbons as they separate in the lower atmosphere, we infer the magnetic reconnection rate in terms of the reconnection electric field E-rec inside the reconnecting current sheet (RCS) and the rate of magnetic flux convected into the diffusion region. For the X1.6 flare event, the inferred E-rec is similar to5.8 V cm(-1) and the peak mass acceleration is similar to3 km s(-2), while for the M1.0 flare event E-rec is similar to0.5 V cm(-1) and the peak mass acceleration is 0.2-0.4 km s(-2).

   cis-bis(4-carboxy-2-[2
   '-(4-carboxypyridyl)]quinoline)bis(thiocyanato-N)ruthenium(II)
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB We compared the spectral (IR and Raman), electrochemical, and photoelectrochemical properties of nanocrystalline TiO2 sensitized with the newly synthesized complex [NBu4](2)[cis-Ru(Hdcpq)(2)(NCS)(2)] (1; [NBu4](+) = tetrabutylammonium cation; H(2)dcpq = 4-carboxy-2-[2'-(4'-carboxypyridyl)]quinoline) with those of TiO2 sensitized with [NBu4](2)[cis-Ru(HdcbPY)(2)(NCS)(2)] (2; H(2)dcbpy = 4,4'-dicarboxy-2,2'-bipyridine) and [NBu4](2)[cis-Ru(Hdcbiq)(2)(NCS)(2)] (3; H(2)dcbiq = 4,4'-dicarboxy-2,2'-biquinoline). Complex 1 achieved efficient sensitization of nanocrystalline TiO2 films over a wide visible and near-IR region, generating a large short-circuit photocurrent. The absorbed photon-to-current conversion efficiency decreased in the order 2 > 1 > 3 with the decrease in the free energy change (-DeltaG(inj)) of the electron injection from the ruthenium complex to TiO2. The open-circuit photovoltages (V-oc's) of dye-sensitized solar cells decreased in the order 2 > 1 > 3 with the increase in the dark current resulting from reverse electron transfer from TiO2 to I-3(-). The sensitizer-dependent V-oc value can be interpreted as a result of reverse electron transfer through the sensitizing dye molecules.

TI Average spectra of massive galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB We combine Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra of 22,000 luminous, red, bulge-dominated galaxies to get high signal-to-noise ratio average spectra in the rest-frame optical and ultraviolet ( 2600 7000 A). The average spectra of these massive, quiescent galaxies are early type with weak emission lines and with absorption lines indicating an apparent excess of alpha-elements over solar abundance ratios. We make average spectra of subsamples selected by luminosity, environment, and redshift. The average spectra are remarkable in their similarity. What variations do exist in the average spectra as a function of luminosity and environment are found to form a nearly one-parameter family in spectrum space. We present a high signal-to-noise ratio spectrum of the variation. We measure the properties of the variation with a modified version of the Lick index system and compare to model spectra from stellar population syntheses. The variation may be a combination of age and chemical abundance differences, but the conservative conclusion is that the quality of the data considerably exceeds the current state of the models.

TI Renewable energy potential and utilization in Turkey
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB Renewable energy sources have been important for humans since the beginning of civilisation. For centuries, and in many ways, biomass has been used for heating, and cooking. Many centuries ago, mankind was already utilizing the clearly visible power of water for mechanical drive purposes, as was also the case with wind. Today, water mills are still used in our villages, although their numbers are going to diminish. On the other hand, Turkey is an energy importing country with more than half of the energy requirement being supplied by imports, and air pollution is becoming a great environmental concern in the country. In this regard, renewable energy resources appear to be one of the most efficient and effective solutions for sustainable energy development and environmental pollution prevention in Turkey. Turkey's geographical location has several advantages for extensive use of most of the renewable energy sources. Because of this and the fact that it has limited fossil fuel resources, a gradual shift from fossil fuels to renewables seems to be serious and the sole alternative for Turkey. This article presents a review of recent studies on the renewable energy sources, their potential and present use in Turkey. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this work, we examine the effect of crystallinity and therefore the trap-state density on the dynamics of interfacial electron transfer between adsorbates and nanoparticles. Subpicosecond mid-IR and visible transient absorption spectroscopic techniques were used to study electron-injection and recombination dynamics of TiO2 and ZrO2 nanoparticles and nanocrystalline thin films sensitized with catechol and coumarin-343. Comparison of dynamics in materials with different crystallinity demonstrates that electron recombination dynamics are strongly dependent on the preparation method, and the effect on injection dynamics is significant when the injection energy level is near the conduction band edge.

TI The impact of galaxy formation on the X-ray evolution of clusters
SO MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
AB We present a new model for the X-ray properties of the intracluster medium that explicitly includes heating of the gas by the energy released during the evolution of cluster galaxies. We calculate the evolution of clusters by combining the semi-analytic model of galaxy formation of Cole et al. with a simple model for the radial profile of the intracluster gas. We focus on the cluster X-ray luminosity function and on the relation between X-ray temperature and luminosity (the T-L relation). Observations of these properties are known to disagree with predictions based on scaling relations that neglect gas cooling and heating processes. We show that cooling alone, is not enough to account for the flatness of the observed T-L relation or for the lack of strong redshift evolution in the observed X-ray luminosity function. Gas heating, on the other hand, can solve these two problems: in the A cold dark matter cosmology, our model reproduces fairly well the T-L relation and the X-ray luminosity function. Furthermore, it predicts only weak evolution in these two properties out to z = 0.5, in agreement with recent observational data. A successful model requires an energy input of 1-2 x 10(49) erg per solar mass of stars formed. This is comparable to the total energy released by the supernovae associated with the formation of the cluster galaxies. Thus, unless the transfer of supernovae energy to the intracluster gas is very (perhaps unrealistically) efficient, additional sources of energy, such as mechanical energy from active galactic nuclei winds are required. However, the amplification of an initial energy input by the response of the intracluster medium to protocluster mergers might ease the energy requirements. Our model makes definite predictions for the X-ray properties of groups and clusters at high redshift. Some of these, such as the T-L relation at z similar or equal to 1, may soon be tested with data from the Chandra and Newton satellites.

TI Detection of a far-infrared excess with DIRBE at 60 and 100 microns
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB From analysis of the DIRBE weekly averaged sky maps, we have detected substantial flux in the 60 and 100 mum channels in excess of expected zodiacal and Galactic emission. Two methods are used to separate zodiacal light from more distant emission. Method I makes use of the time dependence of the north-south annual variation observed at the ecliptic poles. This method is robust against errors in the interplanetary dust (IPD) model but does not demonstrate isotropy of the background. Method II measures the ecliptic latitude dependence of the dust over a range of ecliptic latitudes (/beta/ > 35 degrees) at solar elongation e = 90 degrees. This allows the excess to be determined in each week of the DIRBE mission for high redundancy, but the results depend weakly on the IPD model. Both methods give consistent results at 60 and 100 mum. The observed signal is consistent with an isotropic background at the level nuI(nu) = 28.1 +/- 1.8 +/- 7(syst) nW m(-2) sr(-1) at 60 mum and 24.6 +/- 2.5 +/- 8 nW m(-2) sr(-1) at 100 mum.
   The IR excess detected at 140 and 240 mum by these methods agrees with previous measurements, which are thought to be the cosmic infrared background (CIB). The detections at 60 and 100 mum are new. The integrated IR excess in the window 45-125 mum is 23 +/- 8 nW m(-2) sr(-1), to be added to the 18 +/- 4 nW m(-2) sr(-1) previously measured with the DIRBE and FIRAS instruments in the window 125-2 mm. While this new excess is not necessarily the GIB, we have ruled out all known sources of emission in the solar system and Galaxy. We therefore tentatively interpret this signal as the CIB and consider the implications of such energy production from the viewpoint of star formation efficiency and black hole accretion efficiency. However, the IR excess exceeds limits on the CIB derived from the inferred opacity of the intergalactic medium to observed TeV photons, thus casting doubt on this interpretation. There is currently no satisfactory explanation for the 60-100 Clm excess.

TI Self-organized criticality in the substorm phenomenon and its relation
   to localized reconnection in the magnetospheric plasma sheet
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
AB Evidence is presented that suggests that there is a significant self-organized criticality (SOC) component in the dynamics of substorms in the magnetosphere. We assume that observations of bursty bulk flows, fast flows, localized dipolarizations, plasma turbulence, etc, show that multiple localized reconnection sites provide the basic avalanche phenomenon in the establishment of SOC in the plasma sheet. First results are presented from a study of this avalanche process based on this working assumption. A magnetic field reversal model is discussed. Resistivity, in this model, is self-consistently generated in response to the excitation of an idealized current-driven instability. When forced by convection of magnetic flux into the field reversal region, the model yields rapid magnetic field annihilation through a dynamic behavior that is shown to exhibit many of the characteristics of SOC. Over a large range of forcing strengths, the annihilation rate is shown to self-adjust to balance the rate at which flux is convected into the reversal region. Several analogies to magnetotail dynamics are discussed: (1) It is shown that the presence of a localized criticality in the model produces a remarkable stability in the global configuration of the field reversal while simultaneously exciting extraordinarily dynamic internal evolution. (2) Under steady forcing it is shown that a loading-unloading cycle may arise that, as a consequence of the global stability, is quasi-periodic and, therefore, predictable despite the presence of internal turbulence in the field distribution. indeed, it is shown that the global loading-unloading cycle is a consequence of the internal turbulence. (3) It is shown that under steady, strong forcing the loading-unloading cycle vanishes. Instead, a recovery from a single unloading persists indefinitely. The field reversal is globally very steady while internally it is very dynamic as field annihilation goes on at the rate necessary to match the strong forcing. From this result we speculate that steady magnetospheric convection events result when the plasma sheet has been driven close to criticality over an extended spatial domain. During these events we would expect to find localized reconnection sites distributed over the spatial domain of near criticality, and we would expect to find plasma sheet transport in that domain to be closely related to that of BBF and fast flow events.

TI An analytical model for estimating canopy transpiration and carbon
   assimilation fluxes based on canopy light-use efficiency
SO AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB We develop a simple, analytical model for canopy resistance to canopy-atmosphere gas exchange that is well suited for incorporation into regional-scale land-surface parameterizations. This model exploits the conservative nature of canopy light-use efficiency (LUE) in carbon assimilation that is observed within broad categories of plant species. The model paradigm assumes that under standard environmental conditions, a canopy will operate at the field-measured LUE, but will deviate from this standard efficiency as conditions change. Effective LUE estimates generated by the model respond to variations in atmospheric humidity, CO2 concentration, the composition of solar irradiation (direct versus diffuse beam fractions), and soil moisture content. This modeling approach differs from scaled-leaf parameterizations in that a single estimate of nominal canopy LUE replaces both a detailed mechanistic description of leaf-level photosynthetic processes and the scaling of these processes from the leaf to canopy level. This results in a model that can be evaluated analytically, and is thus computationally efficient and requires few species-specific parameters. Both qualities lend themselves well to regional-and global-scale modeling efforts. For purposes of testing, this canopy resistance submodel has been embedded in the Atmosphere-Land Exchange (ALEX) surface energy balance model. The integrated model generates transpiration and carbon assimilation fluxes that compare well with estimates from iterative mechanistic photosynthetic models, and with Aux measurements made in stands of corn, soybean, prairie grasses, desert shrubs, rangeland, and black spruce. Comparisons between modeled and measured evapotranspiration (LE) and carbon assimilation (A(c)) fluxes yield mean-absolute-percent-differences of 24% (LE) and 33% (A(c)) for hourly daytime fluxes, and 12% (LE) and 18% (A(c)) for daily-integrated fluxes. These comparisons demonstrate robustness over a variety of vegetative and climatic regimes, suggesting that this simple analytical model of canopy resistance will be useful in regional-scale flux evaluations.

TI The generation of lightning in the solar nebula
SO ICARUS
CT Protostars and Planets IV Conference (PPIV)
CY JUL, 1998
CL SANTA BARBARA, CA
AB The process that melted and formed the chondrules, millimeter-sized glassy beads within meteorites, has not been conclusively identified. Origin by lightning in the solar nebula is consistent with many features of chondrules, but no viable model of lightning has yet been advanced. We present a model demonstrating how lightning could be generated in the solar nebula which differs from previous models in two important aspects. First, we identify a new, powerful charging mechanism that is based on the differences in contact potentials between particles of different composition, a form of triboelectric charging. In the presence of fine silicate grains and fine iron metal grains, large silicate particles (the chondrules) can acquire charges greater than or similar to +10(5) e. Second, we assume that the chondrule precursor particles are selectively concentrated in clumps similar to 100 km in size by the turbulent concentration mechanism described by J. N. Cuzzi et al. (1996, in Chondrules and the Protoplanetary Disk, pp. 35-43, Cambridge Univ. Press). The concentration of these highly charged particles into clumps, in a background of negatively charged metal grains, is what generates the strong electric fields.
   We calculate that electric fields large enough to trigger breakdown easily could have existed over regions large enough (similar to 100 km) to generate very large discharges of electrical energy (similar to 10(16) erg), assuming a lightning bolt width 10 electron mean-free paths. The discharges would have been sufficiently energetic to have formed the chondrules. We place constraints on the generation of lightning and conclude that it could not be generated if the abundance of (26)Al in chondrules was as high as the level in the calcium-aluminumrich inclusions (CAIs). This conclusion is consistent with isotopic analyses of chondrules. This possibly implies that (26)Al was nonuniformly distributed in the solar nebula or that the chondrules formed several million years after the CAIs. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

TI Ethanol synthesis by genetic engineering in cyanobacteria
SO APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB Cyanobacteria are autotrophic prokaryotes which carry out oxygenic photosynthesis and accumulate glycogen as the major form of stored carbon. In this research, we introduced new genes into a cyanobacterium in order to create a novel pathway for fixed carbon utilization which results in the synthesis of ethanol. The coding sequences of pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase II (adh) from the bacterium Zymomonas mobilis were cloned into the shuttle vector pCB4 and then used to transform the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942. Under control of the promoter from the rbcLS operon encoding the cyanobacterial ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, the pdc and adh genes were expressed at high levels, as demonstrated by Western blotting and enzyme activity analyses. The transformed cyanobacterium synthesized ethanol, which diffused from the cells into the culture medium. As cyanobacteria have simple growth requirements and use light, CO2, and inorganic elements efficiently, production of ethanol by cyanobacteria is a potential system for bioconversion of solar energy and CO2 into a valuable resource.

TI Coronal heating in active regions as a function of global magnetic
   variables
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB A comparison of X-ray images of the Sun and full disk magnetograms shows a correlation between the locations of the brightest X-ray emission and the locations of bipolar magnetic active regions. This correspondence has led to the generally accepted idea that magnetic fields play an essential role in heating the solar corona.
   To quantify the relationship between magnetic fields and coronal heating, the X-ray luminosity of many different active regions is compared with several global (integrated over entire active region) magnetic quantities, The X-ray measurements were made with the SXT Telescope on the Yohkoh spacecraft; magnetic measurements were made with the Haleakala Stokes Polarimeter at the University of Hawaii's Mees Solar Observatory.
   The combined data set consists of 333 vector magnetograms of active regions taken between 1991 and 1995; X-ray luminosities are derived from time averages of SXT full-frame desaturated (SFD) images of the given active region taken within +/-4 hours of each magnetogram. Global magnetic quantities include the total unsigned magnetic flux Phi(tot) = integral dA\B-z\B-z, tot(2) = integral dAB(z)(2), J(tot) = integral dA\J(z)\, and B-perpendicular to,B- (2)(tot) = integral dAB(perpendicular to)(2), where J(z) is the vertical current density and B-z and B-perpendicular to are the vertical and horizontal magnetic field amplitudes, respectively.
   The X-ray luminosity L-x is highly correlated with all of the global magnetic variables, but it is best correlated with the total unsigned magnetic flux Phi(tot). The correlation observed between L-X and the other global magnetic variables can be explained entirely by the observed relationship between those variables and Phi(tot). In particular, no evidence is found that coronal heating is affected by the current variable J(tot) once the observed relationship between L-X and Phi(tot) is accounted for. A fit between L-X and Phi(tot) yields the relationship L-X similar or equal to 1.2 x 10(26) ergs s(-1)(Phi(tot)/10(22) Mx)(1.19).
   The observed X-ray luminosities are compared with the behavior predicted by several different coronal heating theories. The Alfven wave heating model predicts a best relationship between L-X and Phi(tot), similar to what is found, but the observed relationship implies a heating rate greater than the model can accommodate, The "Nanoflare Model" of Parker predicts a best relationship between L-X and B-z,B- (2)(tot) rather than Phi(tot), but the level of heating predicted by the model can still be compared to the observed data. The result is that for a widely used choice of the model parameters, the nanoflare model predicts 1.5 orders of magnitude more heating than is observed. The "Minimum Current Corona" model of Longcope predicts a qualitative variation of L-X with Phi(tot) that agrees with what is observed, but the model makes no quantitative prediction that can be tested with the data. A comparison between L-X and the magnetic energy E-mag in each active region leads to a timescale that is typically 1 month, or about the lifetime of an active region, placing an important observational constraint on coronal heating models.
   Comparing the behavior of solar active regions with nearby active stars suggests that the relationship observed between L-X and Phi(tot) may be a fundamental one that applies over a much wider range of conditions than is seen on the Sun.

TI The Geospace Environment Modeling Grand Challenge: Results from a Global
   Geospace Circulation Model
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
AB We have used our Global Geospace Circulation Model (GGCM) to simulate two time intervals that were proposed as the Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) Grand Challenge for modelers to investigate to what extent and accuracy models can predict the ionosphere's response to the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field. In this paper we present comparisons of our GGCM with the comprehensive experimental study by Lyons [this issue] (which provided synoptic maps of the polar cap electrodynamics and particle precipitation) for the two time intervals, January 27, 1992, 1325-1715 UT and 1730-1930 UT. We find a very good agreement between the potential patterns predicted by our model and those obtained by the assimilative mapping of ionospheric electrodynamics (AMIE) procedure. We also find that the separatrix and cusp locations predicted by our model generally compare well with those obtained from particle precipitation data. The soft electron zone of ionospheric precipitation, as defined by Lyons, lies almost entirely in the region for which our model predicts open field lines. However, the model predicts cross polar cap potential drops that are roughly a factor of 2 larger than those predicted by AMIE.

TI Radiative-convective equilibrium in a three-dimensional cloud-ensemble
   model
SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
AB A knowledge of radiative convective interactions is key to an understanding of the tropical climate. in an attempt to address this a cloud-resolving model has been run to a radiative-convective equilibrium state in three dimensions. The model includes a three-phase bulk microphysical scheme and a fully interactive two-stream broadband radiative-transfer scheme for both the infrared and solar radiation. The simulation is performed using a fixed sea surface temperature, and cyclic lateral boundary conditions. No 'large-scale' convergence, mean wind shear or background vorticity was imposed.
   The total integration lasted 70 days, and a statistical equilibrium state was reached at all heights after 30 days of simulation in all model variables. It is seen that some variables, such as vertical mass flux, adjust quickly to their equilibrium values while others, such as column-integrated water amount, domain-mean temperature and convective available potential energy (CAPE) display variation on a longer 30-day time-scale. The equilibrium state had a column-integrated vapour amount of 42.3 kg m(-2), a mean temperature of 258.7 K and a pseudo-adiabatic CAFE value of 1900 J kg(-1). The equilibrium-state statistics are consistent with tropical observations.
   The convection does not remain randomly distributed but instead becomes organized, aligning in a band structure associated with high moisture values in the boundary layer. This organization seems to result from interactions between radiation, convection and surface fluxes. The surface-flux feedback is due to higher boundary-layer winds, associated with convection, increasing surface fluxes of moisture locally. Horizontally inhomogeneous radiation can act to make clouds longer lasting and also increase convergence into cloudy region. Replacing the wind-sensitive surface-flux calculation with a linear relaxation to surface values appeared to largely destroy this organization, as did the use of an imposed horizontally uniform radiative-heating rate.

TI Evidence against turbulent and canopy-like magnetic fields in the solar
   chromosphere
SO NATURE
AB Measurements of the degree of polarization of light in the spectral lines emitted by gas near the Sun's limb (its outer edge) can be used to investigate the electron densities and magnetic field strengths in the solar atmosphere; these quantities are important for determining the balance and transport of energy through the Sun's atmosphere. Recent measurements(1,2) revealed a surprising degree of polarization in the sodium doublet; these observations have remained an enigma, Here I report a mechanism that may ex-plain these observations, in which it is assumed that the populations of the magnetic sublevels of the electronic ground state of the sodium atom are not equal: this leads to ground-level atomic polarization, This mechanism explains very well the observed line shapes, and implies that depolarization does not occur in the solar chromosphere, which would seem to rule out the existence of turbulent magnetic fields and of horizontal, canopy-like fields stronger than similar to 0.01 G, This is difficult to understand, because there is substantial evidence from other types of observation for both types of field(3-10). There are obviously aspects of the Sun's atmosphere that remain very poorly understood.

TI Are energetic electrons in the solar wind the source of the outer
   radiation belt?
SO GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Using data from WIND, SAMPEX (Solar, Anomalous, and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer), and the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) sensors onboard geostationary satellites, we investigate the correlation of energetic electrons in the 20-200 keV range in the solar wind and of high speed solar wind streams with relativistic electrons in the magnetosphere to determine whether energetic electrons in the solar wind are the source of the outer relativistic electron radiation belt. Though there is some correlation between energetic electron enhancements in the solar wind and enhancements in the outer radiation belt, the phase space density of 20-200 keV electrons in the solar wind is not adequate to supply the outer radiation belt electrons. Although lower energy electrons in the solar wind could be a seed population of the outer radiation belt, such lower energy electrons cannot achieve relativistic energies through the normal process of radial transport which conserves the first adiabatic invariant. Thus additional internal acceleration processes are required within the magnetosphere to produce the outer radiation belt. High speed solar wind streams are well correlated with increased magnetic activity and with increased fluxes in the outer radiation belt. The maximum correlation between the high speed streams and the radiation belt flux occurs with an increasing time delay for higher energies and and lower L values. We conclude that acceleration processes within the magnetosphere which are well correlated with high speed solar wind streams are responsible for the outer radiation belt electrons.

TI Comparison of proxy records of climate change and solar forcing
SO GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB The role of solar variability as a cause of decadalcentennial scale climate change continues to be a topic of debate. Herein we compare two estimates of solar variability since 1600 with two estimates of northern hemispheric temperature change. Sun-climate correlations vary between 0.57-0.74 and are significant at the 95% level. However, the small number of oscillations in the time series suggests to us that longer records are needed for a more convincing demonstration of a significant sun-climate linkage. Forcing of an energy balance model with the solar time series indicates that modest amounts of solar variability and climate sensitivity yield temperature variations that represent a significant fraction of the inferred changes during the Little Ice Age. This latter result further supports the hypothesis that solar variability may be significantly contributing to climate change on decadal-centennial time scales.

SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB By means of a systemic analysis of the relationships among components of an ecosystem's web, the flows of energy and other resources converging to produce the output (biomass, biodiversity, assets, etc.) can be evaluated on a common basis, i.e. the content of solar equivalent energy (emergy). Indices and ratios based on the emergy flows can be calculated and used to evaluate the behaviour of the whole system. In this paper, one of these indices, the emergy yield ratio eta (total yield emergy per unit of emergy invested) is evaluated and suggestions made to modify it to account for present and future environmental damages due to the use of a given resource. The meaning of this index, with and without the proposed modification, is stressed illustrating the long-term effects of environmental pollution as well as some key uncertainty factors that are very often not taken into account.

TI THE SOFT-X-RAY MICROWAVE RATIO OF SOLAR AND STELLAR FLARES AND CORONAE
SO ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
AB We have carried out plasma diagnostics of solar flares using soft X-ray (SXR) and simultaneous microwave observations and have compared the ratio of X-ray to microwave luminosities of solar flares with various active late-type stars available in the published literature. Both the SXR low-level ('quiescent') emission from stellar coronae and the flaring emission from the Sun and stars are generally interpreted as thermal radiations of coronal plasmas. On the other hand, the microwave emission of stars and solar flares is generally attributed to an extremely hot or nonthermal population of electrons. Solar flare SXR are conventionally measured in a narrower and harder passband than the stellar sources. Observations of the GOES-2 satellite in two energy channels have been used to estimate the luminosity of solar flares as it would appear in the ROSAT satellite passband.
   The solar and stellar flare luminosities fit well at the lower end of the active stellar coronae. The flare SXR/microwave ratio is similar to the ratio for stellar coronae. The average ratio follows a power-law relation L(X) is-proportional-to L(R)0.73 +/- 0.03 over 10 orders of magnitude from solar microflares to RS CVn and FK Com-type coronae. Dwarf Me and Ke stars, and RS CVn stars are also compatible with a linear SXR/microwave relation, but the ratio is slightly different for each type of star. Considering the differerces between solar flares, stellar flares and the various active stellar coronae, the similarity of the SXR/microwave ratios is surprising. It suggests that the energetic electrons in low-level stellar coronae observed in microwaves are related in a similar way to the coronal thermal plasma as flare electrons to the flare thermal plasma, and, consequently, that the heating mechanism of active stellar coronae is a flare-like process.

TI SOLAR NEUTRINOS AND NUCLEAR-REACTIONS IN THE SOLAR INTERIOR
SO ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
AB We discuss the results of Homestake and Kamioka experiments, showing that if the results of these experiments are taken at their face values - one way to save ''conventional neutrinos'' is to look for a nuclear solution decreasing both Be-7 and B-8 neutrino fluxes with respect to the predictions of the standard solar models. Recent GALLEX results appear in agreement with such a conclusion. We discuss the sensitivity of the B-8 and Be-7 neutrino fluxes to the behaviour of the low energy He-3 + He-3 and He-3 + He-4 cross sections. We derive analytically the dependence of the neutrino fluxes on the low energy nuclear cross sections. This analytical approach has been supported by numerical experiments based on a new Standard Solar Model. In the non-resonant case, reduction of the neutrino fluxes to about 1/3 of the Standard Solar Model could be obtained if the true value of S34(0) is three times smaller than the presently accepted extrapolated value. Alternatively, one should have S33(0) wrong by a factor nine. A resonance in the He-3 + He-3 channel could yield a sufficient reduction of B-8 neutrinos and, furthermore, a suppression of Be-7 neutrinos larger than that of B-8 neutrinos provided that E(R) less-than-or-equal-to 21.4 keV, an energy region so far almost unexplored experimentally. We show that future experiments in underground laboratories should be able to explore the region down to E(R) = 10 keV with a significant sensitivity. We also compare our Standard Solar Model with the results of previous calculations.

TI THE DETECTION OF X-RAYS FROM THE HOT INTERSTELLAR-MEDIUM OF THE LARGE
   MAGELLANIC CLOUD
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB We present a comprehensive reanalysis of the Einstein Observatory imaging survey of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Techniques necessary for the study of faint diffuse X-rays, including the decontamination of images from solar scattered X-rays, are described in detail. A discrete source search of a approximately 37 deg2 region in the vicinity of the LMC reveals 105 sources, 33 of which are reported here for the first time. About half of the sources are clearly identified with objects in that galaxy, while the remainder are shown to be predominantly foreground stars and background AGNs. Subtraction of all discrete emitters reveals extensive diffuse X-ray emission associated with the LMC. The spectrum of this emission is well fitted by an optically thin thermal plasma with temperatures ranging from approximately 2 x 10(6) K in the western part of the galaxy to approximately 10(7) K in the vicinity of the active star formation complex near 30 Doradus. An anticorrelation of H I and diffuse X-rays on scales of less-than-or-similar-to 1 kpc is consistent with a picture in which superbubbles of hot gas are created in the neutral ISM by the combined action of stellar winds and supernovae in massive stellar associations. Over a substantial fraction of the galaxy, the hot ISM is seen to have an emissivity and a pressure significantly in excess of that in the medium surrounding the Sun. Estimates of the cooling and heating rates for the hot gas suggest that a substantial fraction of the energy input from stellar winds and SNs either radiates in other wavelength bands or leaves the galaxy in the form of a wind. The prospects for using the LMC as a testbed for global ISM models is briefly discussed.

Catalysts play very important roles in two half reactions of water splitting - water reduction and water oxidation. Considering potential future applications, catalysts made of cheap and earth abundant element(s) are especially important for economically viable energy conversion. This article focuses only on catalysts made of cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni) and iron (Fe) elements for water reduction and water oxidation.

TI Anthropogenic Chemical Carbon Cycle for a Sustainable Future
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Nature's photosynthesis uses the sun's energy with chlorophyll in plants as a catalyst to recycle carbon dioxide and water into new plant life. Only given sufficient geological time, millions of years, can new fossil fuels be formed naturally. The burning of our diminishing fossil fuel reserves is accompanied by large anthropogenic CO2 release, which is outpacing nature's CO2 recycling capability, causing significant environmental harm. To supplement the natural carbon cycle, we have proposed and developed a feasible anthropogenic chemical recycling of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is captured by absorption technologies from any natural or industrial source, from human activities, or even from the air itself. It can then be converted by feasible chemical transformations into fuels such as methanol, dimethyl ether, and varied products including synthetic hydrocarbons and even proteins for animal feed, thus supplementing our food chain. This concept of broad scope and framework is the basis of what we call the Methanol Economy. The needed renewable starting materials, water and CO2, are available anywhere on Earth. The required energy for the synthetic carbon cycle can come from any alternative energy source such as solar, wind, geothermal, and even hopefully safe nuclear energy. The anthropogenic carbon dioxide cycle offers a way of assuring a sustainable future for humankind when fossil fuels become scarce. While biosources can play a limited role in supplementing future energy needs, they increasingly interfere with the essentials of the food chain. We have previously reviewed aspects of the chemical recycling of carbon dioxide to methanol and dimethyl ether. In the present Perspective, we extend the discussion of the innovative and feasible anthropogenic carbon cycle, which can be the basis of progressively liberating humankind from its dependence on diminishing fossil fuel reserves while also controlling harmful CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. We also discuss in more detail the essential stages and the significant aspects of carbon capture and subsequent recycling. Our ability to develop a feasible anthropogenic chemical carbon cycle supplementing nature's photosynthesis also offers a new solution to one of the major challenges facing humankind.

TI Selective Inter layers and Contacts in Organic Photovoltaic Cells
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) are promising solar electric energy conversion systems with impressive recent optimization of active layers. OPV optimization must now be accompanied by the development of new charge-selective contacts and interlayers. This Perspective considers the role of interface science in energy harvesting using OPVs, looking back at early photoelectrochemical (photogalvanic) energy conversion platforms, which suffered from a lack of charge carrier selectivity. We then examine recent platforms and the fundamental aspects of selective harvesting of holes and electrons at opposite contacts. For blended heterojunction OPVs, contact/interlayer design is especially critical because charge harvesting competes with recombination at these same contacts. New interlayer materials can modify contacts to both control work function and introduce selectivity and chemical compatibility with nonpolar active layers and add thermodynamic and kinetic selectivity to charge harvesting. We briefly discuss the surface and interface science required for the development of new interlayer materials and take a look ahead at the challenges yet to be faced in their optimization.

TI Nanostructured Hybrid Polymer-Inorganic Solar Cell Active Layers Formed
   by Controllable in Situ Growth of Semiconducting Sulfide Networks
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Nanostructured composites of inorganic and organic materials are attracting extensive interest for electronic and optoelectronic device applications. In this paper, we introduce a general method for the fabrication of metal sulfide nanoparticle/polymer films employing a low-cost and low temperature route compatible with large-scale device manufacturing. Our approach is based upon the controlled in situ thermal decomposition of a solution processable metal xanthate precursor complex in a semiconducting polymer film. To demonstrate the versatility of our method, we fabricate a CdS/P3HT nanocomposite film and show that the metal sulfide network inside the polymer film assists in the absorption of visible light and enables the achievement of high yields of charge photogeneration at the CdS/P3HT heterojunction. Photovoltaic devices based upon such nanocomposite films show solar light to electrical energy conversion efficiencies of 0.7% under full AM1.5 illumination and 1.2% under 10% incident power, demonstrating the potential of such nanocomposite films for low-cost photovoltaic devices.

TI Efficient and stable dye-sensitized solar cells based on phenothiazine
   sensitizers with thiophene units
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY
AB Three new phenothiazine organic dyes containing thiophene, 3-(5-(3-(4-(bis(4-methoxy phenyl) amino)phenyl)-10-octyl-10H-phenothiazin-7-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-2-cyanoacrylic acid (P1), 3-(5-(3-(4-(diphenylamino)phenyl)-10-octyl-10H-phenothiazin-7-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-2-cyanoacrylic acid (P2) and 2-cyano-3-(5-(10-octyl-3-(4-(2,2-diphenylvinyl)phenyl)-10H-phenothiazin-7-yl)thiophen-2-yl) acrylic acid (P3) were designed and synthesized as sensitizers for application in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). For these dyes, the phenothiazine derivative moiety and the cyanoacetic acid take the roles of electron donor and electron acceptor, respectively. The absorption spectra, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of P1-P3 and the cell long-term stability were extensively investigated. It was found that HOMO and LUMO energy level tuning can be conveniently accomplished by alternating the donor moiety. The DSSCs based on dye P2 showed the best photovoltaic performance: a maximum monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of 84.9%, a short-circuit photocurrent density (J(sc)) of 10.84 mA cm(-2), an open-circuit photovoltage (V(oc)) of 592 mV, and a fill factor (ff) of 0.69, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency of 4.41% under standard global AM 1.5 solar light conditions. These results demonstrated that the DSSCs based on phenothiazine dyes could achieve both high performance and good stability.

AB Non-Conventional Energy Sources, such as solar and hydrogen energy will remain available for infinite period. One of the reasons of great worry for all of us is reducing sources of conventional energies. The rate of fossil fuel consumption is higher than the rate of the fossil fuel production by the nature. The results will be the scarcity of automobile fuel in the world which will create lot of problems in transport sector. The other aspect is pollution added by these sources in our environment which increases with more use of these sources, resulting in the poor quality of life on this planet. There is constant search of alternate fuel to solve energy shortage which can provide us energy without pollution.
   Hence most frequently discussed source is hydrogen which when burnt in air produces a clean form of energy. In the last one decade hydrogen has attracted worldwide interest as a secondary energy carrier. This has generated comprehensive investigations on the technology involved and how to solve the problems of production, storage and transportation of hydrogen. The interest in hydrogen as energy of the future is due to it being a clean energy, most abundant element in the universe, the lightest fuel, richest in energy per unit mass and unlike electricity, it can be easily stored. Hydrogen gas is now considered to be the most promising fuel of the future. In future it will be used in various applications, e.g. it can generate Electricity, useful in cooking food, fuel for automobiles, hydrogen powered industries, jet Planes, Hydrogen Village and for all our domestic energy requirements.
   Hydrogen as a fuel has already found applications in experimental cars and all the major car companies are in competition to build a commercial car and most probably they may market hydrogen fuel automobiles in near future but at a higher cost compared to gasoline cars but it is expected that with time the cost of hydrogen run cars will decrease with time. Long lasting, light and clean metal hydride batteries are already commercial for lap top computers. Larger capacity batteries are being developed for electrical cars. Hydrogen is already being used as the fuel of choice for space programmes around the world. it will be used to power aerospace transports to build the international space station, as well as to provide electricity and portable water for its inhabitants. Present article deals with the storage and applications of hydrogen in the present energy scenario. (C) 2009 International Association for Hydrogen Energy. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Penumbral Structure and Outflows in Simulated Sunspots
SO SCIENCE
AB Sunspots are concentrations of magnetic field on the visible solar surface that strongly affect the convective energy transport in their interior and surroundings. The filamentary outer regions (penumbrae) of sunspots show systematic radial outward flows along channels of nearly horizontal magnetic field. These flows were discovered 100 years ago and are present in all fully developed sunspots. By using a comprehensive numerical simulation of a sunspot pair, we show that penumbral structures with such outflows form when the average magnetic field inclination to the vertical exceeds about 45 degrees. The systematic outflows are a component of the convective flows that provide the upward energy transport and result from anisotropy introduced by the presence of the inclined magnetic field.

TI Solar Surface Convection
SO LIVING REVIEWS IN SOLAR PHYSICS
AB We review the properties of solar convection that are directly observable at the solar surface, and discuss the relevant underlying physics, concentrating mostly on a range of depths from the temperature minimum down to about 20 Mm below the visible solar surface.
   The properties of convection at the main energy carrying (granular) scales are tightly constrained by observations, in particular by the detailed shapes of photospheric spectral lines and the topology (time- and length-scales, flow velocities, etc.) of the up- and downflows. Current supercomputer models match these constraints very closely, which lends credence to the models, and allows robust conclusions to be drawn from analysis of the model properties.
   At larger scales the properties of the convective velocity field at the solar surface are strongly influenced by constraints from mass conservation, with amplitudes of larger scale horizontal motions decreasing roughly in inverse proportion to the scale of the motion. To a large extent, the apparent presence of distinct (meso- and supergranulation) scales is a result of the folding of this spectrum with the effective "filters" corresponding to various observational techniques. Convective motions on successively larger scales advect patterns created by convection on smaller scales; this includes patterns of magnetic field, which thus have an approximately self-similar structure at scales larger than granulation.
   Radiative-hydrodynamical simulations of solar surface convection can be used as 2D/3D time- dependent models of the solar atmosphere to predict the emergent spectrum. In general, the resulting detailed spectral line pro files agree spectacularly well with observations without invoking any micro- and macroturbulence parameters due to the presence of convective velocities and atmosphere inhomogeneities. One of the most noteworthy results has been a significant reduction in recent years in the derived solar C, N, and O abundances with far-reaching consequences, not the least for helioseismology.
   Convection in the solar surface layers is also of great importance for helioseismology in other ways; excitation of the wave spectrum occurs primarily in these layers, and convection influences the size of global wave cavity and, hence, the mode frequencies. On local scales convection modulates wave propagation, and supercomputer convection simulations may thus be used to test and calibrate local helioseismic methods.
   We also discuss the importance of near solar surface convection for the structure and evolution of magnetic patterns: faculae, pores, and sunspots, and briefly address the question of the importance or not of local dynamo action near the solar surface. Finally, we discuss the importance of near solar surface convection as a driver for chromospheric and coronal heating.

TI Appropriate strategies for determining the photoconversion efficiency of
   water photo electrolysis cells: A review with examples using titania
   nanotube array photoanodes
SO SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS
AB Proper determination of light to chemical energy conversion efficiency of a photoelectrochemical cell is critical in evaluating its performance. Since the demonstration of photocatalytic water splitting using semiconductor electrodes, many strategies have been suggested and employed for the determination of photoconversion efficiency. We review these approaches as well as factors limiting ideal case efficiencies. Cell efficiency values are found to vary considerably depending upon the errors involved in the basic assumptions and measurement procedures. With researchers using different expressions for efficiency calculation, the values can be inconsistent and a direct comparison meaningless; we demonstrate this with the help of photocurrent data obtained from a photoelectrolysis cell employing titania nanotube array photoanodes. We find, and demonstrate, that realistic solar photoconversion. efficiencies can be estimated with the help of incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) values and solar irradiance data using the expression: ratio of the net power output to the power supplied by the incident light, where the net power output is the difference between the maximum electrical power available from the hydrogen produced and the power supplied by an external source. The power from the external source is determined by taking product of the photocurrent and the potential difference between the working and counter electrodes. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

TI High photovoltage achieved in low band gap polymer solar cells by
   adjusting energy levels of a polymer with the LUMOs of fullerene
   derivatives
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY
AB Solar cells based on organic molecules or conjugated polymers attract great attention due to their unique advantages, such as low cost, and their use in flexible devices, but are still limited by their low power conversion efficiency (PCE). To improve the PCEs of polymer solar cells, more efforts have been made to increase short-circuit current (J(sc)) or open-circuit voltage (V(oc)). However, the trade-off between J(sc) and V(oc) in bulk heterojunctions solar cells makes it tricky to find a polymer with a low band gap to efficiently absorb photons in the visible and near infrared region of the solar spectrum, while maintaining a high V(oc) in solar cells. Therefore, it is crucial to design and synthesize polymers with energy levels aligning with the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) of an electron acceptor to minimize the LUMO level difference between donor and acceptor to keep enough driving force for charge generation, thereby maximizing photovoltage in solar cells. Here a novel copolymer APFO-Green 9 was synthesized. Polymer solar cells based on APFO-Green 9 blended with a derivative of fullerene demonstrate high photovoltage by fine tuning the HOMO and LUMO level of APFO-Green 9. Solar cells based on APFO-Green 9 and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester ([70]PCBM) present a photoresponse extended to 900 nm with J(sc) of 6.5 mA cm(-2), V(oc) of 0.81 V and PCE of 2.3% under illumination of AM1.5 with light intensity of 100 mW cm(-2). As a low band gap polymer with a V(oc) bigger than 0.8 V, APFO-Green 9 is a promising candidate for efficient tandem solar cells.

TI Trends in aerosol radiative effects over Europe inferred from observed
   cloud cover, solar "dimming" and solar "brightening"
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
AB [ 1] We examine multidecadal changes in surface downward shortwave ( SW) radiation flux, total cloud cover, SW cloud effect, and related parameters over Europe during 1965 2004 using monthly gridded data from the Global Energy Balance Archive (GEBA), synoptic cloud reports, and the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP). One key issue is distinguishing the effects of natural cloud variability from long-term anthropogenic aerosol influences on surface SW flux. Accordingly, we introduce the concept of cloud cover radiative effect (CCRE), defined as the change in downward SW flux produced by a change in cloud cover. The correlation between pan-European time series of CCRE anomalies and GEBA solar radiation anomalies is 0.88, indicating that cloud cover variability and associated changes in cloud albedo dominate SW radiation variability on monthly to decadal timescales. After these weather-related cloud effects are removed by subtracting CCRE anomalies from GEBA solar radiation anomalies via linear regression, a distinct decreasing trend followed by a distinct increasing trend remain in the residual time series. Depending on the method of trend calculation, pan-European residual flux declined by a statistically significant 2.7 - 3.5 W m(-2) per decade during 1971 - 1986 and rose by a statistically significant 2.0 - 2.3 W m(-2) per decade during 1987 - 2002. The fact that independent grid boxes exhibit mostly negative trends in the earlier period and mostly positive trends in the later period demonstrates that these long-term variations in SW flux are real and widespread over Europe. Changes in cloud cover cannot account for the trends in surface SW flux since cloud cover actually slightly decreased during 1971 - 1986 and slightly increased during 1987 - 2002. The most likely explanation is changes in anthropogenic aerosol emissions that led to more scattering and absorption of SW radiation during the earlier period of solar "dimming'' and less scattering and absorption during the later period of solar "brightening.''

TI The analyzer of space plasmas and energetic atoms (ASPERA-3) for the
   mars express mission
SO SPACE SCIENCE REVIEWS
CT Workshop on Solar Wind Interaction and Atmosphere Evolution of Mars
CY FEB 27-MAR 01, 2006
CL Kiruna, SWEDEN
AB The general scientific objective of the ASPERA-3 experiment is to study the solar wind atmosphere interaction and to characterize the plasma and neutral gas environment within the space near Mars through the use of energetic neutral atom (ENA) imaging and measuring local ion and electron plasma. The ASPERA-3 instrument comprises four sensors: two ENA sensors, one electron spectrometer, and one ion spectrometer. The Neutral Particle Imager (NPI) provides measurements of the integral ENA flux (0.1 - 60 keV) with no mass and energy resolution, but high angular resolution. The measurement principle is based on registering products ( secondary ions, sputtered neutrals, reflected neutrals) of the ENA interaction with a graphite-coated surface. The Neutral Particle Detector (NPD) provides measurements of the ENA flux, resolving velocity ( the hydrogen energy range is 0.1 10 keV) and mass ( H and O) with a coarse angular resolution. The measurement principle is based on the surface reflection technique. The Electron Spectrometer (ELS) is a standard top-hat electrostatic analyzer in a very compact design which covers the energy range 0.01 - 20 keV. These three sensors are located on a scanning platform which provides scanning through 180 degrees of rotation. The instrument also contains an ion mass analyzer (IMA). Mechanically IMA is a separate unit connected by a cable to the ASPERA-3 main unit. IMA provides ion measurements in the energy range 0.01 - 36 keV/charge for the main ion components H(+), He(++), He(+), O(+), and the group of molecular ions 20 - 80 amu/q. ASPERA-3 also was its own DC/DC converters and digital processing unit (DPU).

TI lAn explanation of the Voyager paradox: Particle acceleration at a blunt
   termination shock
SO GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Voyager 1 recently crossed the termination shock at the edge of our heliosphere. In contrast to the expectations of essentially all prior models, however, Voyager 1 did not observe the source of Anomalous Cosmic Rays (ACRs) as had been widely anticipated. We show here that the dearth of higher energy particles near the nose of the heliosphere is a natural consequence of the magnetic geometry in the region ahead of a flattened shock. Particle energization happens primarily back along the flanks of the shock where the injection energy is lower and where the magnetic field has had progressively longer connection times to accelerate particles. In addition to explaining the most baffling aspects of the Voyager 1 observations, this paradigm makes explicit predictions about what should be observed when Voyager 2 reaches the termination shock, significantly further back from its nose.

TI Relation between absorption and crystallinity of
   poly(3-hexylthiophene)/fullerene films for plastic solar cells
SO CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The photovoltaic action of plastic solar cells based oil P3HT/PCBM- (poly[3-hexylthiophetie-2,5-diyl]/[6,6]-phenyl C-61 butyric acid methyl ester)-composites depends strongly on structure of the active layer. In this work, the impact of P3HT-crystallinity oil optical absorption of P3HT/PCBM-films was investigated. We observed, that both P3HT-crystallinity and optical absorption of thermally annealed films are increased in comparison to the not annealed ones. The highest crystallinity was achieved for films annealed at 125 degrees C. Further increase of annealing temperature leads to decrease of P3HT crystallinity. It is shown that the absorption coefficient of the films at low photon energies is proportional to the area under the X-ray-diffraction peak, which is a measure for the degree of film crystallinity.

TI Dust growth and settling in protoplanetary disks and disk spectral
   energy distributions. I. Laminar disks
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB Dust growth and settling considerably affect the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of protoplanetary disks. We investigated dust growth and settling in protoplanetary disks through numerical simulations to examine time evolution of the disk optical thickness and SEDs. In this paper we considered laminar disks as the first step in a series of papers. As a result of dust growth and settling, a dust layer forms around the midplane of a gaseous disk. After the formation of the dust layer, small dust grains remain floating above the layer. Although the surface density of the floating small grains is much less than that of the dust layer, they govern the disk optical thickness and the emission. Size distributions of the floating grains obtained from numerical simulations are well described by a universal power-law distribution, which is independent of the disk temperature, the disk surface density, the radial position in the disk, etc. The floating small grains settle onto the dust layer in a long timescale compared with the formation of the dust layer. Typically, it takes 10(6) yr for micron-sized grains. Rapid grain growth in the inner part of disks makes the radial distribution of the disk optical thickness less steep than that of the disk surface density, &USigma;. For disks with &USigma; &PROP; R-3/2, the radial distribution of the optical thickness is almost flat for all wavelengths at t &LE; 10(6) yr. At t &GT; 10(6) yr, the optical thickness of the inner disk (&LSIM; a few AU) almost vanishes, which may correspond to disk inner holes observed by Spitzer Space Telescope. Furthermore, we examined time evolution of disk SEDs, using our numerical results and the two-layer model. The grain growth and settling decrease the magnitude of the SEDs, especially at &lambda; &GE; 100 &mu; m. Our results indicate that grain growth and settling can explain the decrease in observed energy fluxes at millimeter/submillimeter wavelengths with timescales of 10(6)-10(7) yr without depletion of the disks.

TI Evaluation of the MODIS aerosol retrievals over ocean and land during
   CLAMS
SO JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
AB The Chesapeake Lighthouse Aircraft Measurements for Satellites (CLAMS) experiment took place from 10 July to 2 August 2001 in a combined ocean-land region that included the Chesapeake Lighthouse [Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) Ocean Validation Experiment (COVE)] and the Wallops Flight Facility (WFF), both along coastal Virginia. This experiment was designed mainly for validating instruments and algorithms aboard the Terra satellite platform, including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Over the ocean, MODIS retrieved aerosol optical depths (AODs) at seven wavelengths and an estimate of the aerosol size distribution. Over the land. MODIS retrieved AOD at three wavelengths plus qualitative estimates of the aerosol size. Temporally coincident measurements of aerosol properties were made with a variety of sun photometers from ground sites and airborne sites just above the surface. The set of sun photometers provided unprecedented spectral coverage from visible (VIS) to the solar near-infrared (NIR) and infrared (IR) wavelengths. In this study. AOD and aerosol size retrieved from MODIS is compared with similar measurements from the sun photometers. Over the nearby ocean, the MODIS AOD in the VIS and NIR correlated well with sun-photometer measurements, nearly fitting a one-to-one line on a scatterplot. As one moves from ocean to land, there is a pronounced discontinuity of the MODIS AOD, where MODIS compares poorly to the sun-photometer measurements. Especially in the blue wavelength, MODIS AOD is too high in clean aerosol conditions and too low under larger aerosol loadings. Using the Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) radiative code to perform atmospheric correction. the authors find inconsistency, in the surface albedo assumptions used by the MODIS lookup tables. It is demonstrated how the high bias at low aerosol loadings can be corrected. By using updated urban/industrial aerosol climatolog for the MODIS lookup table over land, it is shown that the low bias for larger aerosol loadings can also be corrected. Understanding and improving MODIS retrievals over the East Coast may point to strategies for correction in other locations, thus improving the global quality of MODIS. Improvements in regional aerosol detection could also lead to the use of MODIS for monitoring air pollution.

TI Fullerene-(pi-conjugated oligomer) dyads as active photovoltaic
   materials
SO SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS
AB The recent developments on organic photovoltaic cells using covalently linked fullerene-(pi-conjugated oligomer) ensembles as the active layer are reviewed. This molecular approach appears to be particularly interesting since the bicontinuous donor-acceptor network obtained by chemically linking the hole-conducting moiety to the electron-conducting fullerene subunit prevents any problem arising from bad contacts at the junction, as observed for polymer/C-60 blends. Furthermore, the behavior of a unique molecule in a photovoltaic cell and the study of its electronic properties means one can easily obtain the structure/activity relationships leading to a better understanding of the photovoltaic conversion. Finally, this new synthetic approach offers great versatility for design tuning of the photovoltaic system. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A coronal thick-target interpretation of two hard X-ray loop events
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB We report a new class of solar flare hard X-ray (HXR) sources in which the emission is mainly in a coronal loop so dense as to be collisionally thick at electron energies up to greater than or similar to 50 keV. In most of the events previously reported, most of the emission is at the dense loop footpoints, although sometimes with a faint high-altitude component. HXR RHESSI data on loop dimensions and nonthermal electron parameters and GOES soft X-ray data on hot loop plasma parameters are used to model coronal thick-target physics for two "discovery" events (2002 April 14 [23: 56 UT] and 2002 April 15 [23: 05 UT]). We show that loop column densities N are consistent with (1) a nonthermal coronal thick-target interpretation of the HXR image and spectrum; (2) chromospheric evaporation by thermal conduction from the hot loop rather than by electron beam heating; and (3) the hot loop temperature being due to a balance of thick-target collisional heating and (mainly) conductive cooling.

TI Electronic transport in dye-sensitized nanoporous TiO2 solar
   cells-comparison of electrolyte and solid-state devices
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B
AB This article compares the electronic transport properties of dye-sensitized solar cells using a liquid electrolyte with those of one using an organic hole conductor. Both types of solar cells differ by the reference energies for recombination and, in particular, by their recombination probabilities of photoinjected electrons from the titanium dioxide into the respective contact medium. For voltages below 0.8 V, the junction impedance of the electrolyte cell is dominated by diffusion and recombination of electrons from the TiO2 into the electrolyte. The impedance of the solid state exhibits a negative reactance, that is, an inductive behavior, which we attribute to conductivity modulation of the hole conductor by injected electrons.

TI Stellar metallicity and the formation of extrasolar gas giant planets
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB Spectroscopic searches for extrasolar planets are most successful when the target star has high metallicity, a trend that may be caused by observational selection effects, pollution by ingested planetary material, or a requirement of high metallicity for gas giant planet formation. We show that in the scenario of the disk instability mechanism for forming gas giant protoplanets, clump-forming gravitational instabilities proceed in much the same manner in protoplanetary disks with metallicities that vary by factors of 10 greater or less than that of a standard disk model. This remarkable insensitivity to the dust grain opacity is attributed to radiative energy losses from the disks being controlled more by their being embedded in a thermal bath determined by their central protostar than by radiative fluxes deep within the disks' optically thick midplanes. This result suggests that if disk instability is the primary formation mechanism for extrasolar gas giant planets, even relatively low-metallicity galactic disk stars should harbor gas giant planets.

TI First results from the RAPID imaging energetic particle spectrometer on

SO ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE
AB The advanced energetic particle spectrometer RAPID on board Cluster can provide a complete description of the relevant particle parameters velocity, V, and atomic mass, A, over an energy range from 30 keV up to 1.5 MeV. We present the first measurements taken by RAPID during the commissioning and the early operating phases. The orbit on 14 January 2001, when Cluster was travelling from a perigee near dawn northward across the pole towards an apogee in the solar wind, is used to demonstrate the capabilities of RAPID in investigating a wide variety of particle populations. RAPID, with its unique capability of measuring the complete angular distribution of energetic particles, allows for the simultaneous measurements of local density gradients, as reflected in the anisotropies of 90degrees particles and the remote sensing of changes in the distant field line topology, as manifested in the variations of loss cone properties. A detailed discussion of angle-angle plots shows considerable differences in the structure of the boundaries between the open and closed field lines on the nightside fraction of the pass and the magnetopause crossing. The 3 March 2001 encounter of Cluster with an FTE just outside the magnetosphere is used to show the first structural plasma investigations of an FTE by energetic multi-spacecraft observations.

TI Chromospheric damping of Alfven waves
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB We analytically study the damping of Alfven mode oscillations in the chromosphere and in coronal loops. In the partially ionized chromosphere the dominant damping process of Alfven waves is due to collisions between ions and neutrals. We calculate the damping time for Alfven waves of a given frequency, propagating through model chromospheres of various solar structures such as active region plage, quiet sun, and the penumbra and umbra of sunspots. For a given wave frequency, the maximum damping always occurs at temperature minimum heights and in the coldest structure(s), i.e., the umbra of sunspots. Energy dissipation due to ion-neutral damping of Alfven waves with an energy flux of 10(7) ergs cm(-3) s(-1) can play a considerable role in the energy balance of umbrae, quiet sun, and plage for Alfven wave periods of the order, respectively, 50, 5, and 0.5 s. We also consider Alfven waves in coronal loops and the leakage of wave energy through the footpoints. We assume a three-layer model of coronal loops with constant Alfven speed upsilon (A) (and no damping) in the corona, upsilon (A) varying exponentially with height in the dissipative chromosphere, and upsilon (V) again constant in the photosphere at the end of the loop. We find an exact analytical solution in the chromospheric part. Using these solutions, we estimate the leakage of wave energy from the coronal volume through the footpoint regions of the loop and find that the presence of a moderate amount of chromospheric damping can enhance the footpoint leakage. We apply this result to determine the damping time of standing waves in coronal loops. The enhanced footpoint leakage also has implications for theories of coronal heating based on resonant absorption. Finally, we find exact expressions for the damping of Alfven waves launched in the photosphere and upward propagating through the chromosphere and into the corona. The partially ionized chromosphere presents an effective barrier for upward propagating waves with periods less than a few seconds.

TI Evolution of leaf-form in land plants linked to atmospheric CO2 decline
   in the Late Palaeozoic era
SO NATURE
AB The widespread appearance of megaphyll leaves, with their branched veins and planate form, did not occur until the close of the Devonian period at about 360 Myr ago. This happened about 40 Myr after simple leafless vascular plants first colonized the land in the Late Silurian/Early Devonian(1,2), but the reason for the slow emergence of this common feature of present-day plants is presently unresolved. Here we show, in a series of quantitative analyses using fossil leaf characters and biophysical principles, that the delay was causally linked with a 90% drop in atmospheric pCO(2) during the Late Palaeozoic era(3,4). In contrast to simulations for a typical Early Devonian land plant, possessing few stomata(5) on leafless stems, those for a planate leaf with the same stomatal characteristics indicate that it would have suffered lethal overheating, because of greater interception of solar energy and low transpiration. When planate leaves first appeared in the Late Devonian and subsequently diversified in the Carboniferous period, they possessed substantially higher stomatal densities(6). This observation is consistent with the effects of the pCO(2) on stomatal development(7) and suggests that the evolution of planate leaves could only have occurred after an increase in stomatal density, allowing higher transpiration rates that were sufficient to maintain cool and viable leaf temperatures.

TI Fungal melanins as a sun screen for symbiotic green algae in the lichen
   Lobaria pulmonaria
SO OECOLOGIA
AB The mycobiont of the high-light-susceptible forest lichen Lobaria pulmonaria was shown to deposit brown, melanic compounds in the outer layer of the upper cortex, depending on the long-term level of solar radiation in its natural habitat. Furthermore, pale thalli from a shady habitat produced melanic compounds after transplantation to a sunny habitat. This browning of the cortex appeared to be a physiologically active process, taking place only during periods with frequent hydration. Melanin production was slow. After transplantation. more than 1 year was needed for a shade-adapted thallus to reduce the cortical transmittance (230-1000 nm) to a similar level to that of naturally sun-exposed specimens. Melanic compounds acted as a sun screen, especially reducing UVB and UVA wavelengths, but also visible wavelengths, at the photobiont Level. In the near infrared range, there was only a small difference in transmittance between shade- and sun-adapted cortices. A negative correlation was found between the natural light level and the cortical transmittance of wavelengths below 700 nm. However, previous studies have shown that even photobionts of melanic L. pulmonaria thalli are relatively susceptible to high-light exposure. Since melanins also increase the absorbance of solar energy for the whole thallus, it appears that what is gained in terms of UV- and light protection in melanic L. pulmonaria specimens may be offset by increased exposure to excess temperatures for this highly heat-susceptible lichen.

AB In this study, two integrated PV/electrolysis systems were studied. An integrated PV/electrolysis device is a device where the PV system and the electrolyser are combined into a single system. In the case studied here, the areas of the PV device and the electrolyzer are identical. Multijunction photovoltaic (PV)/electrolysis configurations were investigated, and a high solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency cell demonstrated. The energy diagram of the configuration has been evaluated and exemplified with n/p, n/p-GalnP/GaAs(Pt)/KOH electrolyte and triple-junction p-i-n a-Si(Pt)/KOH electrolyte photovoltaic/electrolysis cells. The efficiency of the cells was determined based on the short-circuit photocurrent. Measurements were obtained both indoors under 100-mW/cm(2) insolation, and outdoors. For the a-Si system, a 7.8% solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency was demonstrated. For the GaAs/GaInP2 system, the solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency was over 16%.

In this paper, that is the first of a series, we propose a method that solves the boundary value problem set in the functional space of regular solutions (i.e., that do not contain current sheets). This is an iterative method introduced by Grad and Rubin. It is associated with a well-posed boundary-value problem. We present some results obtained with this method on two exact solutions of the magnetostatic equations, used as theoretical magnetograms. Unlike some other extrapolations methods, that are associated with ill-posed boundary value problems, our method allows extrapolation to arbitrarily large heights, with no blowing up due to the presence in these methods of an intrinsic instability that makes errors growing up exponentially.

TI Local hydrodynamic stability of accretion disks
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB We employ a variety of numerical simulations in the local shearing box system to investigate in greater depth the local hydrodynamic stability of Keplerian differential rotation. In particular, we explore the relationship of Keplerian shear to the nonlinear instabilities known to exist in simple Cartesian shear. The Coriolis force is the source of linear stabilization in differential rotation. We exploit the formal equivalence of constant angular momentum flows and simple Cartesian shear to examine the transition from stability to nonlinear instability. The manifestation of nonlinear instability in simple shear flows is known to be sensitive to initial perturbation and the amount of viscosity; marginally (linearly) stable differentially rotating flows exhibit this same sensitivity. Keplerian systems, however, are completely stable; stabilizing Coriolis forces easily overwhelm any destabilizing nonlinear effects. If anything, nonlinear effects speed the decay of applied turbulence by producing a rapid cascade of energy to high wavenumbers where dissipation occurs. We test our conclusions with grid-resolution experiments and by comparing the results of codes with very different diffusive properties. The detailed agreement of the decay of nonlinear disturbances found repeatedly in codes with very different diffusive behaviors strongly suggests that Keplerian stability is not a numerical artifact. The properties of hydrodynamic differential rotation are contrasted with magnetohydrodynamic differential rotation, a kinetic stress tensor couples to the outwardly increasing vorticity, which limits turbulence; a magnetic stress couples to the outwardly decreasing shear, which promotes turbulence. Thus magnetohydrodynamic turbulence is uniquely capable of acting as a turbulent angular momentum transport mechanism in disks.

TI The peculiar type II supernova 1997D: A case for a very low Ni-56 mass
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB SN 1997D in NGC 1536 is possibly the least luminous and energetic Type II supernova discovered to date. The entire light curve is subluminous, never reaching M-v = -14.65. The radioactive tail follows the Co-56 decay slope. In the case of a nearly complete trapping of the gamma-rays, the Ni-56 mass derived from the tail brightness is extremely small, similar to 0.002 M.. At discovery, the spectra showed a red continuum and line velocities on the order of 1000 km s(-1). The luminosity and the photospheric expansion velocity suggest that the explosion occurred about 50 days before discovery and that a plateau probably followed. Model light curves and spectra of the explosion of a 26 M. star successfully fitted the observations. Low-mass models are inconsistent with the observations. The radius of the progenitor, constrained by the prediscovery upper limits, is R-0 less than or similar to 300 R.. A low explosion energy of similar to 4 x 10(50) ergs is then required in the modeling. The strong Pa II lines in the photospheric spectra are reproduced with a solar abundance and low T-eff. A scenario in which the low Ni-56 mass observed in SN 1997D is due to fallback of material onto the collapsed remnant of the explosion of a 25-40 M. star appears to be favored over the case of the explosion of an 8-10 M. star with low Ni-56 production.

TI Interplanetary magnetic clouds, helicity conservation, and current-core
   flux-ropes
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
AB A current-core flux-rope model for interplanetary magnetic clouds is presented which explains their average thermodynamic and magnetic properties. It is assumed that during a magnetic cloud's evolution, its total magnetic helicity, flux and mass are conserved and that the dynamics of a cloud is governed by the Lorentz self-force acting on its curved portions. Total magnetic energy and current in a magnetic cloud decrease monotonically as it elongates. Part of this magnetic energy is lost in overcoming solar gravity, part goes into the bulk kinetic energy, and the rest can be assumed to go into heating the plasma inside the cloud. Due to this dissipation of magnetic energy as heat, the temperature of an expanding cloud goes through a maximum before the cloud leaves the corona. The temperature may reach 1.7 x 10(6) K. As a cloud expands into interplanetary space, the total plasma beta asymptotically approaches a constant value between 0.39 and 0.52, irrespective of its initial value. Apart from explaining the heating and expansion of magnetic clouds, this model also provides expressions (scaling laws) for the magnetic field strength, temperature, radius, density, asymmetry of the magnetic field strength profile, slope of the plasma velocity profile inside clouds, and plasma beta, as functions of distance from the Sun. These theoretical results are compared with cloud data obtained between 0.3 and 4 AU from the Sun. The comparisons show a good agreement between observation and theory.

TI MASSIVE SUPERNOVAE, ORION GAMMA-RAYS, AND THE FORMATION OF THE
   SOLAR-SYSTEM
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB We discuss the source of the enhanced carbon and oxygen low-energy cosmic-ray flux in the Orion star-forming region and attribute it to the acceleration of the surface layers of a massive supernova, probably of Type Ib. The gamma rays from Orion are produced by that fast CO ejecta. In this model there would be few Orion-like gamma-ray sources in the Galaxy at any one time. We also postulate that a massive supernova produced the short-lived extinct radioactivities injected into the molecular cloud core that produced the solar system. We find that relative to Al-26 the other short-lived extinct radioactivities are excessively produced in massive supernovae but are likely to be more attenuated by postexplosion fallback than Al-26. This is a revival of the supernova trigger hypothesis; to obtain the correct dilutions of the extinct radioactivities, the distance from the supernova to the impacted molecular cloud core must be a few parsecs, and the effective projected collecting area of the cloud must be significantly less than normal core radii.

TI DIFFUSE IONIZED-GAS IN THE SPIRAL GALAXY M31
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB We present a study of diffuse ionized gas (DIG, or WIM for warm ionized medium) in the nearby spiral M31, based on CCD imagery in Halpha and [S II] emission lines. We find that the DIG in M31 contributes 40% of the observed total Halpha luminosity, and at least 20% of the total after correction for extinction. This fraction is constant across the disk of M31. The total Halpha luminosity of M31, corrected for extinction, is about 4.1 x 10(40) ergs s-1. This implies a low star formation rate of about 0.35 M. yr-1, in agreement with earlier estimates. DIG is concentrated near regions of star formation. The average emission measure (EM) perpendicular to the disk ranges from about 6 pc cm-6 in weaker spiral arms to 15 pc cm-6 in the main spiral arms, with (rare) peak values reaching 50 pc cm-6. Overall, the EM in the main arms is substantially higher than that of DIG in the solar neighborhood, implying higher power requirements per unit area in these regions of M31. However, the strong concentration of DIG near regions of star formation keeps the total area covered by DIG in M31 relatively small, which makes it possible to sustain this gas in spite of the low star formation rate. We argue that the DIG extent in vertical direction in M31 may well be lower than in our Galaxy, because of its low star formation rate. A simple parameterization of the electron distribution then shows that the DIG in the spiral arms may contribute between 15% and 40% of the total atomic gas column. The average electron densities implied by the high EMs reached in some regions seem to indicate a higher thermal pressure in the DIG than in the diffuse H I gas in M31. This pressure in-equilibrium can be avoided if part of the diffuse emission is due to a denser component, as proposed most recently by Miller & Cox, because this would reduce the EM and implied pressures for the actual widespread DIG. Column densities of the ionized gas might then be lower as well. We also show, however, that it is not possible to attribute all of the diffuse emission to a relatively dense component, such as earlier proposed extended low-density H II regions. The DIG in M31 shows an overall [S II]/Halpha intensity ratio of 0.5, significantly higher than in discrete H II regions, and similar to that in other galaxies. This number does not vary with radius in M31. There is a suggestion that [S II]/Halpha intensity ratios may be higher at the lowest detectable emission measures, up to 0.7 or even 1. The discrete source population in M31 also shows a trend toward increasing [S II]/Halpha flux ratios as the sources become more diffuse. Few sources (apart from supernova remnants), however, reach the value of 0.5 found in the DIG as a whole. The distinct spectral signature of the DIG in M31, and its energy requirements favor photoionization of the gas, although it is likely that shock ionization occurs in selected regions.

TI ENERGY DENSITY OF IONOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-WIND ORIGIN IONS IN THE
   NEAR-EARTH MAGNETOTAIL DURING SUBSTORMS
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
AB Comprehensive energy density studies provide an important measure of the participation of various sources in energization processes and have been relatively rare in the literature.  We present a statistical study of the energy density of the near-Earth magnetotail major ions (H+, O+, He++, He+) during substorm expansion phase and discuss its implications for the solar wind/magnetosphere/ionosphere coupling.  Our aim is to examine the relation between auroral activity and the particle energization during substorms through the correlation between the AE indices and the energy density of the major magnetospheric ions.  The data we used here were collected by the charge-energy-mass (CHEM) spectrometer on board the AMPTE/CCE satellite in the near-equatorial nightside magnetosphere, at geocentric distances approximately 7-9 R(E).  CHEM provided the opportunity to conduct the first statistical study of energy density in the near-Earth magnetotail with multispecies particle data extending into the higher energy range (greater-than-or-equal-to 20 keV/e).  The use of 1-min AE indices in this study should be emphasized, as the use (in previous statistical studies) of the (3-hour) Kp index or of long-time averages of AE indices essentially smoothed out all the information of substorms.  Most distinct feature of our study is the excellent correlation of O+ energy density with the AE index, in contrast with the remarkably poor He++ energy density - AE index correlation.  Furthermore, we examined the relation of the ion energy density to the electrojet activity during substorm growth phase.  The O+ energy density is strongly correlated with the pre-onset AU index, that is the eastward electrojet intensity, which represents the growth phase current system.  Our investigation shows that the near-Earth magnetotail is increasingly fed with energetic ionospheric ions during periods of enhanced dissipation of auroral currents.  The participation of the ionosphere in the substorm energization processes seems to be closely, although not solely, associated with the solar wind/magnetosphere coupling.  That is, the ionosphere influences actively the substorm energization processes by responding to the increased solar wind/magnetosphere coupling as well as to the unloading dissipation of stored energy with the increased feeding of new material into the magnetosphere.

TI OBSERVATIONS OF POLAR ION OUTFLOWS
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
AB The characteristics of the polar ion outflows as observed in the topside polar ionosphere by the Dynamics Explorer Retarding Ion Mass Spectrometer are reported in this study.  The study is restricted to altitudes between 1000 and 4000 km in order to focus on the phenomenon of the "classical polar wind."  Except insofar as they convect into the polar cap at these altitudes, auroral and cusp/cleft outflows are specifically excluded from this study.  Using a method based on the "relative wind" of ions as seen from the moving spacecraft, averages and variances of the magnetic field-aligned ion flux and velocity, and the species densities, are derived and binned for examination of their altitudinal, seasonal, and magnetic activity dependencies.  The data set used encompasses the period from autumn 1981 through 1983, the altitude range from 1000 to 4000 km, and invariant latitudes greater than 70-degrees.  Observations of H+, HE+ and O+ with energies down to spacecraft potential are reported.  It is found that the polar outflows are not well correlated with common indicators of solar geomagnetic activity.  The average parameters of the outflows exhibit a winter enhancement of He+ flux, a winter decrease in H+ flux, and a summer enhancement of the asymptotic outflow speeds of all species.  The solar F10.7 (and hence EUV) flux is correlated with the acceleration profile of the flows, with slower flow velocities at 2500 km altitude for active solar conditions.  Evidence is found that the H+ flows are, at times, subsonic in the altitude range studied, in contrast to cold polar wind models.

TI Structures and Spectral Variations of the Outer Heliosphere in IBEX
   Energetic Neutral Atom Maps
SO SCIENCE
AB The Interstellar Boundary Explorer ( IBEX) has obtained all-sky images of energetic neutral atoms emitted from the heliosheath, located between the solar wind termination shock and the local interstellar medium (LISM). These flux maps reveal distinct nonthermal (0.2 to 6 kilo-electron volts) heliosheath proton populations with spectral signatures ordered predominantly by ecliptic latitude. The maps show a globally distributed population of termination-shock-heated protons and a superimposed ribbonlike feature that forms a circular arc in the sky centered on ecliptic coordinate (longitude lambda, latitude beta) = (221 degrees, 39 degrees), probably near the direction of the LISM magnetic field. Over the IBEX energy range, the ribbon's nonthermal ion pressure multiplied by its radial thickness is in the range of 70 to 100 picodynes per square centimeter AU ( AU, astronomical unit), which is significantly larger than the 30 to 60 picodynes per square centimeter AU of the globally distributed population.

TI Changing feedbacks in the climate-biosphere system
SO FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB Ecosystems influence climate through multiple pathways, primarily by changing the energy, water, and greenhouse-gas balance of the atmosphere. Consequently, efforts to mitigate climate change through modification of one pathway, as with carbon in the Kyoto Protocol, only partially address the issue of ecosystem-climate interactions. For example, the cooling of climate that results from carbon sequestration by plants may be partially offset by reduced land albedo, which increases solar energy absorption and warms the climate. The relative importance of these effects varies with spatial scale and latitude. We suggest that consideration of multiple interactions and feedbacks could lead to novel, potentially useful climate-mitigation strategies, including greenhouse-gas reductions primarily in industrialized nations, reduced desertification in and zones, and reduced deforestation in the tropics. Each of these strategies has additional ecological and societal benefits. Assessing the effectiveness of these strategies requires a more quantitative understanding of the interactions among feedback processes, their consequences at local and global scales, and the teleconnections that link changes occurring in different regions.

TI Ce 3d XPS investigation of cerium oxides and mixed cerium oxide
   (CexTiyOz)
SO SURFACE AND INTERFACE ANALYSIS
AB This article presents an XPS study of Ce 3d emission spectra dominated by atomic multiplet effects in core level spectroscopy of rare earth compounds (Ce oxides). Core level spectroscopy has been used to study the electronic states of Ce 3d(5/2) and Ce 3d(3/2) levels in Ce4+ and Ce3+ states. The well-resolved components of Ce 3d5/2 and Ce 3d3/2 spin-orbit components, due to various final states (4f(0), 4f(1), 4f(2) configurations), were determined on 3d XPS spectra from commercial powders (CeO2, CePO4).
   These results were used to study the 3d spin-orbit component of mixed cerium-titanium oxide.
   This compound was prepared by co-melting commercial powders of CeO2 and TiO2 at 1800 K under air using a solar furnace with a flux density of 16 MW.m(-2) at the focal point of the parabolic concentrator. The mixed oxide Ce2Ti2O7 was produced and contained Ce(III) species which may be reactive with water to give back the initial metal oxides and generate hydrogen, a valuable product considered as a promising energy carrier in the future in replacement of oil.
   The 3d photoemission spectra revealed the presence of mixed components attributed to mainly Ce(III) and Ce(IV) species. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Engineering photosynthetic light capture: impacts on improved solar
   energy to biomass conversion
SO PLANT BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL
AB The main function of the photosynthetic process is to capture solar energy and to store it in the form of chemical 'fuels'. Increasingly, the photosynthetic machinery is being used for the production of biofuels such as bio-ethanol, biodiesel and bio-H-2. Fuel production efficiency is directly dependent on the solar photon capture and conversion efficiency of the system. Green algae (e.g. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) have evolved genetic strategies to assemble large light-harvesting antenna complexes (LHC) to maximize light capture under low-light conditions, with the downside that under high solar irradiance, most of the absorbed photons are wasted as fluorescence and heat to protect against photodamage. This limits the production process efficiency of mass culture. We applied RNAi technology to down-regulate the entire LHC gene family simultaneously to reduce energy losses by fluorescence and heat. The mutant Stm3LR3 had significantly reduced levels of LHCI and LHCII mRNAs and proteins while chlorophyll and pigment synthesis was functional. The grana were markedly less tightly stacked, consistent with the role of LHCII. Stm3LR3 also exhibited reduced levels of fluorescence, a higher photosynthetic quantum yield and a reduced sensitivity to photoinhibition, resulting in an increased efficiency of cell cultivation under elevated light conditions. Collectively, these properties offer three advantages in terms of algal bioreactor efficiency under natural high-light levels: (i) reduced fluorescence and LHC-dependent heat losses and thus increased photosynthetic efficiencies under high-light conditions; (ii) improved light penetration properties; and (iii) potentially reduced risk of oxidative photodamage of PSII.

TI Phosphonic acid adsorption at the TiO2 anatase (101) surface
   investigated by periodic hybrid HF-DFT computations
SO SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Phosphonic acid (H3PO3) is a candidate as an anchor group that can be used to bind a wide range of molecules to TiO2 surfaces, with practical applications for example in dye-sensitized solar cells. Adsorption geometries and energies of H3PO3 on the TiO2 anatase (101) surface have therefore been investigated using quantum-chemical periodic hybrid ab initio Hartree Fock density functional theory calculations employing the B3LYP functional and a split-valence basis set. According to the calculations, the most stable adsorption arrangement is a molecular monodentate configuration with a calculated adsorption energy of 47.1 kcal/mol. There are several additional molecular monodentate and dissociative bidentate adsorption modes with calculated adsorption energies exceeding 40 kcal/mol. For comparison, we have also calculated the adsorption strength of formic acid (HCOOH), which is the currently most widely used anchor Group in the solar cell applications, at the same level of theory, to be weaker than 30 kcal/mol. The greater adsorption strength of phosphonic acid compared to formic acid is in good agreement with experimental observations regarding differences in the long-term stability between the two different anchor groups. Implications of the current findings for the design of better dye-sensitized solar cells are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The adjustable, high sol-gel phase transition temperature of 1,3: 2,4-di-O-dimethylbenzylidene-D-sorbitol (DMDBS) with a 3-methoxypropionitrile-based electrolyte made this particular organic gelator very attractive in dye sensitized solar cells. For example, with an amphiphilic ruthenium dye and a quasi-solid-state gel electrolyte system based on 1,3: 2,4-di-O-dimethylbenzylidene-D-sorbitol/3-methoxypropionitrile, a stable overall solar energy conversion efficiency of 6.1% was achieved at AM 1.5 sunlight illumination (99.8 mW cm(-2)).

AB Solar energy will shortly be in great demand since it is inexhaustible and cleaner than any conventional energy resources. At present, an expensive grade of silicon for semiconductor (SEG-Si) is used for a solar cell to convert solar energy into electricity. However, the amount of supply is limited and we have to develop an innovative process for silicon production with low energy cost in order to spread the solar cell system widely. Using relatively inexpensive metallurgical grade silicon (MG-Si) as a starting material for making solar grade silicon (SOG-Si) is believed to be one of the ways to make solar cells less expensive. Impurities in MG-Si will shorten the lifetime of excited carriers in silicon solar cell and disturb electric generation. Hence, the removal of impurities from silicon is a significant issue in silicon solar cell fabrication. To discuss the possibility and efficiency of the impurity elimination process, evaluation of thermodynamic properties of impurities in molten silicon such as the activity coefficients and the interaction parameters of harmful impurities has been performed.

AB Time dependent magnetohydrodynamic computations of the flux cancellation mechanism are presented. Previous authors have discussed this mechanism as a possible cause for the formation of prominences and the trigger for prominence eruptions and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). This paper shows that flux cancellation in an energized two-and-one-half-dimensional helmet streamer configuration first leads to the formation of stable flux rope structures. When a critical threshold of flux reduction is exceeded, the configuration erupts violently. Significant amounts of stored magnetic energy are released through magnetic reconnection. The ejected flux rope propagates out into the solar wind and forms an interplanetary shock wave. A similar eruption occurs for a three-dimensional calculation where the ends of the flux rope field lines are anchored to the Sun. The flux cancellation mechanism unifies the processes of prominence formation, prominence eruption, and CME initiation, and thus provides an attractive hypothesis for explaining the cause of these dynamic events.

TI Tail plasma sheet models derived from Geotail particle data
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
AB [1] Simple analytical models have been derived for the first time, describing the 2-D distribution (along and across the Earth's magnetotail) of the central plasma sheet (CPS) ion temperature, density, and pressure, as functions of the incoming solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) parameters, at distances between 10 and 50 R-E. The models are based on a large set of data of the Low-Energy Particle (LEP) and Magnetic Field (MGF) instruments, taken by Geotail spacecraft between 1994 and 1998, comprising 7234 1-min average values of the CPS temperature and density. Concurrent solar wind and IMF data were provided by the Wind and IMP 8 spacecraft. The accuracy of the models was gauged by the correlation coefficient (c.c.) R between the observed and predicted values of a parameter. The CPS ion density N is controlled mostly by the solar wind proton density and by the northward component of the IMF. Being the least stable characteristic of the CPS, it yielded the lowest c.c. R-N = 0.57. The CPS temperature T, controlled mainly by the solar wind speed V and the IMF B-z, gave a higher c.c. R-T = 0.71. The CPS ion pressure P was best controlled by the solar wind ram pressure P-sw and by an IMF-related parameter F = B(perpendicular to)rootsin(theta/2), where B-perpendicular to is the perpendicular component of the IMF and theta is its clock angle. In a striking contrast with N and T, the model pressure P revealed a very high c.c. with the data, R-P = 0.95, an apparent consequence of the force balance between the CPS and the tail lobe magnetic field. No significant dawn-dusk asymmetry of the CPS was found beyond the distance 10 R-E, in line with the observed symmetry of the tail lobe magnetic field. The plasma density N is lowest at midnight and increases toward the tail's flanks. Larger (smaller) solar wind ion densities and northward (southward) IMF B-z result in larger (smaller) N in the CPS. In contrast to the density N, the temperature T peaks at the midnight meridian and falls off toward the dawn/dusk flanks. Faster (slower) solar wind flow and southward (northward) IMF B-z result in a hotter (cooler) CPS. The CPS ion pressure P is essentially a function of only X-GSM in the midtail (20-50 R-E); at closer distances the isobars gradually bend to approximately follow the contours of constant geomagnetic field strength. For northward IMF conditions combined with a slow solar wind, the isobars remain quasi-circular up to larger distances, reflecting a weaker tail current and, hence, more dipole-like magnetic field.

TI The iron K alpha Compton shoulder in transmitted and reflected spectra
SO MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
AB We calculate the equivalent width of the core, and the centroid energy and relative flux of the first-order Compton shoulder of the iron Kalpha emission line from neutral matter. The calculations are performed with Monte Carlo simulations. We explore a large range of column densities for both transmitted and reflected spectra, and study the dependence on the iron abundance. The Compton shoulder is now becoming observable in many objects thanks to the improved sensitivity and/or energy resolution of the XMM-Newton and Chandra satellites, and the present work aims to provide a tool to derive information on the geometry and element abundances of the line-emitting matter from Compton shoulder measurements.

TI The Chandra iron-L X-ray line spectrum of Capella
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB An analysis of the iron L-shell emission in the publicly available spectrum of the Capella binary system, as obtained by the High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer on board the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, is presented. The atomic-state model, based on the HULLAC code, is shown to be especially adequate for analyzing high-resolution X-ray spectra of this sort. Almost all of the spectral lines in the 10-18 Angstrom wavelength range are identified. It is shown that, for the most part, these lines can be attributed to emission from L-shell iron ions in the Capella coronae. Possibilities for electron temperature diagnostics using line ratios of Fe16+ are demonstrated. It is shown that the observed iron-L spectrum can be reproduced almost entirely by assuming a single electron temperature of kT(e) = 600 eV. This temperature is consistent both with the measured fractional ion abundances of iron and with the temperature derived from ratios of Fe16+ lines. A volume emission measure of 10(53) cm(-3) is calculated for the iron L-shell emitting regions of the Capella coronae, indicating a rather small volume of 10(29) cm(3) for the emitting plasma if an electron density of 10(12) cm(-3) is assumed.

TI Rotation and X-ray emission from protostars
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB The ASCA satellite has recently detected variable hard X-ray emission from two class I protostars in the rho Oph cloud, YLW 15 (IRS 43) and WL 6, with a characteristic timescale of similar to 20 hr. In YLW 15, the X-ray emission is in the form of quasi-periodic energetic flares, which we explain in terms of strong magnetic shearing and reconnection between the central star and the accretion disk. The flare modeling, based on the solar analogy, gives us access to the size of the magnetic structures, which in turn allows us to calculate the rotation parameters of the star and the disk. In WL 6, X-ray flaring is rotationally modulated and appears to be more like the solar-type magnetic activity ubiquitous on T Tauri stars. On the basis of these observations, we find that YLW 15 is a fast rotator (near break-up), while WL 6 rotates with a significantly longer period. We thus use X-ray flaring as a "clock" to measure the rotation of protostars. With the help of the mass-radius relation on the stellar "birthline," we derive masses of M(*) similar to 2 M(circle dot) and less than or similar to 0.4 M(circle dot) for the central stars of YLW 15 and WL 6, respectively. YLW 15 thus appears to be a future A star. In the long term, the magnetic interactions between the star and the disk result in magnetic braking and angular momentum loss of the star. A comparison of the rotation behavior of YLW 15 and WL 6 confirms that for solar-mass stars magnetic braking takes place on timescales t(br) similar to a few x 10(5) yr, i.e., of the same order as the estimated duration of the class I protostar stage. The main parameter determining t(br) turns out to be the stellar mass, so that close to the birthline there must be a mass-rotation relation, t(br) similar to proportional to M(*), such that stars with M(*) greater than or similar to 1-2 M(circle dot) are fast rotators, while their lower mass counterparts have had the time to spin down and reach synchronous rotation with the inner surrounding accretion disk. The rapid rotation and strong star-disk magnetic interactions of YLW 15 also naturally explain the observation of "superflares" of X-ray luminosities as high as L(X) greater than or similar to 10(33)-10(34) ergs s(-1) during a few hours, while at the WL 6 stage the lower X-ray luminosities are likely to be of purely stellar origin. The mass-rotation relation through magnetic braking may also explain why so few class I protostars have been detected in X-rays to date, and why they all lie in clusters. In the case of YLW 15, and perhaps also in other protostars, a hot coronal wind (T similar to 10(6) K) may be responsible for the VLA thermal radio emission. This paper thus proposes the first clues to the magnetic properties of protostars, which govern their rotation status and evolution.

TI Hybrid energy storage systems for stand-alone electric power systems:
   optimization of system performance and cost through control strategies
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB The development of remote, renewable-based energy is hindered in part by the lack of affordable energy storage. Requiring power-on-demand from an energy system powered by intermittent or seasonal sources may necessitate one-month's energy storage-an expensive proposition using conventional storage technologies. If multiple energy storage devices with complementary performance characteristics are used together, the resulting 'hybrid energystorage system' can dramatically reduce the cost of energy storage over single storage systems. The coupling of conventional storage batteries with emerging hydrogen technologies provides one such hybrid system. Hydrogen energy storage in this context includes an electrolyzer, hydrogen storage tank, and a fuel cell. An additional component that must be considered is the control system that determines when the various components are used. Since the control system has an effect on component sizes and thus system and operating costs, the control algorithm must be carefully considered for any system with energy storage. For this study, a time-dependent model of a stand-alone, solar powered, battery-hydrogen hybrid energy storage system was developed to investigate energy storage options for cases where supply and demand of energy are not well matched daily or seasonally. Simulations were performed for residential use with measured solar fluxes and simulated hourly loads for a site at Yuma, Arizona, USA, a desert climate at 32.7 N latitude. Renewable-based power not needed to satisfy the load is stored for later use. Two hybrid energy-storage algorithms were considered. The first is a conventional 'state-of-charge' control system that uses the current state of the storage system for control. The second control system presumes knowledge of future demand through a feed-forward, neural net or other 'intelligent' control systems. Both algorithms use battery storage to provide much of the daily energy shifting and hydrogen to provide seasonal energy shifting, thus using each storage technology to its best advantage. The cost of storing energy with a hybrid energystorage scheme was found to be much less expensive than either single storage method, with a hybrid system storage costing 48% of the cost of a hydrogen-only system and only 9% of the cost of a conventional, battery-only system. In addition, the neural-net control system is compared to a standard battery state-of-charge control scheme, and it is shown that neural-net control systems better utilize expensive components and result in less expensive electric power than state-of-charge control systems.

AB If the low energy cross section for He-3 + p --> He-4 + e(+) + nu(e), the 'hep' reaction, is greater than or similar to 20 times larger than the best (but uncertain) theoretical estimates, then this reaction could significantly influence the electron energy spectrum produced by solar neutrino interactions and measured in the SuperKamiokande, SNO, and ICARUS experiments. We compare predicted energy spectra for different assumed hep fluxes and different neutrino oscillation scenarios with the observed SuperKamiokande spectrum. The spectra with enhanced hep contributions provide better fits to the SuperKamiokande data. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI ASCA detection of a superhot 100 million K X-ray flare on the weak-lined
   T Tauri star V773 Tauri
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB We present results of a approximate to 40 ks ASCA observation of the active weak-lined T Tauri star V773 Tau (HD 283447) and the surrounding Barnard 209 dark cloud, obtained in 1995 February. During this observation, V773 Tau exhibited a dramatic X-ray flare, with the X-ray count rate increasing rapidly by a factor of similar to 20, then decreasing exponentially with an e-folding timescale of approximate to 2.3 hr. The peak flare luminosity was at least similar to 10(33) ergs s(-1) (0.7-10 keV; distance = 150 pc), which is among the highest X-ray luminosities observed to date for T Tauri stars. The total energy release was similar to 10(37) ergs. However, the most spectacular aspect of this hare was its temperature, which reached a maximum value of at least 100 million K. Spectral fits near flare maximum give a temperature of similar to 10 keV, which slowly declined to a value similar to 6 keV at the end of the observation. These temperature measurements are based on high signal-to-noise ratio spectra, and provide the first unambiguous evidence for superhot flaring plasma at temperatures of similar to 10(8) K in T Tauri stars. A simple cooling-loop model gives electron densities that are similar to those of solar flares, but requires loop sizes that are comparable to or larger than the star itself. The flare showed other interesting behavior, including a high (and possibly variable) absorption column density, N-H = 4 x 10(22) cm(-2), and an apparent increase in the global metal abundance during the flare.

TI Thermal physics of asteroids - IV. Thermal infrared beaming
SO ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
AB The so called beaming is an important factor when studying the thermal emission from the atmosphereless bodies of the solar system. The emission is non-Lambertian and has a tendency to be "beamed" in the solar direction. The small scale surface roughness is probably the main source of the effect.
   In this paper, the problem is studied theoretically by adding roughness to Lambertian surfaces, and investigate the change in the emission. The radiative transfer problem in the visual and IR is considered and solved simultaneously with the heat conduction problem. This gives the temperature variations over the surface, as caused by shadows and varying slopes on the surface. The beaming is derived by comparing the emission from the rough and smooth surface.
   Two types of roughness approaches are considered. Analytical solutions to the temperature variations are given for surfaces covered with hemispherical segment craters. Numerical methods are used for stochastic surfaces. The latter approach to the roughness is probably closer to the real surfaces, but the former is far easier to apply in practise. The qualitative results of the two surface types are the same. The beaming is enhanced by the increasing the root mean square (r.m.s.) slope, or by increasing the albedo. The beaming produced by the two approaches for a given r.m.s. slope is rather close for a 60 % crater coverage in the spherical crater case.
   The combined effects of heat conduction and the surface roughness is studied. In many cases it is, however, possible to treat them separately which is of major practical importance.
   As an example, IRAS data (Tedesco et al., 1992) of the asteroid 3 June is compared to model thermal light curves produced, with good agreement.

TI Three-flavor atmospheric neutrino anomaly
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We investigate the indications of flavor oscillations that come from the anomalous flavor composition of the atmospheric neutrino flux observed in some underground experiments. We study the information coming from the neutrino-induced mu-like and e-like events both in the sub-GeV energy range (Kamiokande, IMB, Frejus, and NUSEX experiments) and in the multi-GeV energy range (Kamiokande experiment). First we analyze all the data in the limits of pure nu(<mu)><->nu(tau) and nu(mu)<->nu(e) oscillations. We obtain that nu mu<->v nu(e) oscillations provide a better fit, in particular, to the multi-GeV ata. Then we perform a three-flavor analysis in the hypothesis of dominance of one neutrino square mass difference m(2) implying that the neutrino mixing is parametrized by two angles (psi,phi)is an element of[0,pi/2]. We explore the space (m(2),psi,phi) exhaustively, and find the regions favored by the oscillation hypothesis. The results are displayed in a form suited to the comparison with other flavor oscillation searches at accelerator, reactor, and solar v experiments. In the analysis, we pay particular attention to the Earth matter effects, to the correlation of the uncertainties, and to the symmetry properties of the oscillation probability.

TI STOCHASTIC ACCELERATION OF ELECTRONS .1. EFFECTS OF COLLISIONS IN
   SOLAR-FLARES
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB Stochastic acceleration of thermal electrons to nonrelativistic energies is studied under solar flare conditions. We show that, in turbulent regions, electron-whistler wave interactions can result in the acceleration of electrons in times comparable to or shorter than the Coulomb collision time. The kinetic equation describing the evolution of the electron energy distribution including stochastic acceleration by whistlers and energy loss via Coulomb interactions is solved for an initial thermal electron energy spectrum. In general, the shape of the resulting electron distributions are characterized by the energy E(c) where systematic energy gain by turbulence equals energy loss due to Coulomb collisions. For energies less than E(c) the spectra are steep (quasi-thermal) whereas above E(c) the spectra are power laws. We find that hard X-ray spectra computed using the electron distributions obtained from our numerical simulations are able to explain the complex spectral shapes and variations observed in impulsive hard X-ray bursts. In particular, we show that the gradual steepening observed by Lin et al. could be due to a systematic increase in the density of the plasma (due to evaporation) and the increasing importance of collisions instead of the appearance of a superhot thermal component.

TI Hierarchical Nanomorphologies Promote Exciton Dissociation in
   Polymer/Fullerene Bulk Heterojunction Solar Cells
SO NANO LETTERS
AB PTB7 semiconducting copolymer comprising thieno[3,4-b]thiophene and benzodithiophene alternating repeat units set a historic record of solar energy conversion efficiency (7.4%) in polymer/fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells. To further improve solar cell performance, a thorough understanding of structure-property relationships associated with PTB7/fullerene and related organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices is crucial. Traditionally, OPV active layers are viewed as an interpenetrating network of pure polymers and fullerenes with discrete interfaces. Here we show that the active layer of PTB7/fullerene OPV devices in fact involves hierarchical nanomorphologies ranging from several nanometers of crystallites to tens of nanometers of nanocrystallite aggregates in PTB7-rich and fullerene-rich domains, themselves hundreds of nanometers in size. These hierarchical nanomorphologies are coupled to significantly enhanced exciton dissociation, which consequently contribute to photocurrent, indicating that the nanostructural characteristics at multiple length scales is one of the key factors determining the performance of PTB7 copolymer, and likely most polymer/fullerene systems, in OPV devices.

TI A life cycle analysis of polymer solar cell modules prepared using
   roll-to-roll methods under ambient conditions
SO SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS
AB A life cycle analysis was performed on a full roll-to-roll coating procedure used for the manufacture of flexible polymer solar cell modules. The process known as ProcessOne employs a polyester substrate with a sputtered layer of the transparent conductor indium-tin-oxide (ITO). The ITO film was processed into the required pattern using a full roll-to-roll process, employing screen printing of an etch resist and then applying etching, stripping, washing and drying procedures. The three subsequent layers: ZnO, P3HT:PCBM and PEDOT:PSS were slot-die coated and the silver back electrode was screen printed. Finally the polymer solar modules were encapsulated, using a polyester barrier material. All operations except the application of ITO were carried out under ambient conditions. The life cycle analysis delivered a material inventory of the full process for a module production, and an accountability of the energy embedded both in the input materials and in the production processes. Finally, upon assumption of power conversion efficiencies and lifetime for the modules, a calculation of energy pay-back time allowed us to compare this roll-to-roll manufacturing with other organic and hybrid photovoltaic technologies. The results showed that an Energy Pay-Back Time (EPBT) of 2.02 years can be achieved for an organic solar module of 2% efficiency, which could be reduced to 1.35 years, if the efficiency was 3%.

TI Panchromatic engineering for dye-sensitized solar cells
SO ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB The dye-sensitized mesoscopic solar cell has been intensively investigated as a promising photovoltaic cell. Its ecological and economical fabrication processes make it attractive and credible alternative to conventional photovoltaic systems. In contrast to the latter design, the DSC approach separates tasks of light absorption and charge transport. The primary step of light absorption is performed by a sensitizer anchored to the surface of a wide band gap semiconductor. In order to reach a high conversion efficiency, the first requirement is that the sensitizer should absorb as much as possible of the incoming sunlight. Strategies for achieving panchromatic response in dye-sensitized mesoscopic solar cells are discussed.

TI Coupling of Titania Inverse Opals to Nanocrystalline Titania Layers in
   Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B
AB We report a quantitative comparison of the photoaction spectra, short circuit current densities, and power conversion efficiencies of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) that contain bilayers of nanocrystalline TiO2 (nc-TiO2) and titania inverse opal photonic crystals (PCs). Cells were fabricated with PC/nc-TiO2 and nc-TiO2/PC bilayer films off glass/tin oxide anode of the cell, as well as in a split configuration in which the nc-TiO2 and PC layers were deposited on the anode and cathode sides of the cell, respectively. Incident photon current efficiencies at single wavelengths and current-voltage curves in white light were obtained with both cathode and anode side illumination. The results obtained support if model proposed by Miguez and co-workers, in which coupling of the low refractive index PC layer to the higher index nc-TiO2 la er creates a standing wave in the nc-TiO2 layer, enhancing the response of the DSSC in the red region of the spectrum. This enhancement is very sensitive to the degree of physical contact between the two layers. A gap on the order of 200 nm thick, created by a polymer templating technique, is Sufficient to decouple the two layers optically. The coupling of the nc-TiO2 and PC layers across the gap could be improved slightly by treatment with TICl4 vapor. In the bilayer configuration, there is an enhancement in the IPCE across the visible spectrum, which is primarily caused by defect scattering in the PC layer. There is also an increase of 41 20-50 mV in the open circuit photovoltage of the cell. With anode side illumination. the addition of a PC layer to the nc-TiO2 layer increased the efficiency of DSSCs from 6.5 to 8.3% at a constant N719 dye loading of 155 - 160 nmol/cm(2).

TI Metal oxide composites and structures for ultra-high temperature solar
   thermochemical cycles
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
CT 16th International Symposium on the Reactivity of Solids
CY JUN 03-06, 2007
CL Minneapolis, MN
AB Conceptually, thermochemical cycles are heat engines that drive endothermic chemical reactions, e.g., splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen. The two-step metal oxide cycles (typically ferrite-based) are particularly attractive since they are relatively simple, use non-corrosive materials, and involve gas-solid reactions requiring no difficult separations. Additionally, they are potentially the most efficient renewable-energy driven processes for hydrogen production. We are developing a novel concentrating solar power (CSP) driven metal-oxide-based heat engine, the CR5, at the heart of which are rings of a reactive solid that are thermally and chemically cycled to produce oxygen and hydrogen from water in separate and isolated steps. The monolithic ring structures must have high geometric surface area for gas-solid contact and for adsorption of incident solar radiation, and must maintain structural integrity and high reactivity after extensive thermal cycling to temperatures of at least 1,400 degrees C. We have demonstrated through laboratory and on-sun testing that cobalt ferrite/zirconia mixtures fabricated into monolithic structures suitable for the CR5 are mechanically robust and maintain productivity over tens of cycles. We have also demonstrated that carbon dioxide splitting (CDS) to carbon monoxide and oxygen is a thermodynamically favorable alternative to water splitting that can be conducted with both iron- and cerium-based materials.

TI Modeling the whole atmosphere response to solar cycle changes in
   radiative and geomagnetic forcing
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
AB [1] The NCAR Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model, version 3 (WACCM3), is used to study the atmospheric response from the surface to the lower thermosphere to changes in solar and geomagnetic forcing over the 11-year solar cycle. WACCM3 is a general circulation model that incorporates interactive chemistry that solves for both neutral and ion species. Energy inputs include solar radiation and energetic particles, which vary significantly over the solar cycle. This paper presents a comparison of simulations for solar cycle maximum and solar cycle minimum conditions. Changes in composition and dynamical variables are clearly seen in the middle and upper atmosphere, and these in turn affect terms in the energy budget. Generally good agreement is found between the model response and that derived from satellite observations, although significant differences remain. A small but statistically significant response is predicted in tropospheric winds and temperatures which is consistent with signals observed in reanalysis data sets.

AB We consider class of modified f (R) gravities with the effective cosmological constant epoch at the early and late universe. Such models pass most of solar system tests as well they satisfy to cosmological bounds. Despite their very attractive properties, it is shown that one realistic class of such models may lead to significant Newton law corrections at large cosmological scales. Nevertheless, these corrections are small at solar system as well as at the future universe. Another realistic model with acceptable Newton law regime shows the matter instability.

TI Dye-sensitized solar cell using natural dyes extracted from rosella and
   blue pea flowers
SO SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS
AB Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were fabricated using natural dyes extracted from rosella, blue pea and a mixture of the extracts. The light absorption spectrum of the mixed extract contained peaks corresponding to the contributions from both rosella and blue pea extracts. However, the mixed extract adsorbed on TiO2 does not show synergistic light absorption and photosensitization compared to the individual extracts. Instead, the cell sensitized by the rosella extract alone showed the best sensitization, which was in agreement with the broadest spectrum of the extract adsorbed on TiO2 film. In case that the dyes were extracted at 100 degrees C, using water as extracting solvent, the energy conversion efficiency (eta) of the cells consisting of rosella extract alone, blue pea extract alone and mixed extract was 0.37%, 0.05% and 0.15%, respectively. The sensitization performance related to interaction between the dye and TiO2 surface is discussed. The explanations are supported by the light absorption of the extract solution compared to extracts adsorbed on TiO2 and also dye structures. The effects of changing extracting temperature, extracting solvent and pH of the extract solution are also reported. The efficiency of rosella extract sensitized DSSC was improved from 0.37% to 0.70% when the aqueous dye was extracted at 50 degrees C instead of 100 degrees C and pH of the dye was adjusted from 3.2 to 1.0. Moreover, DSSC stability was also improved by the changes in conditions. However, the efficiency of a DSSC using ethanol as extracting solvent was found to be diminished after being exposed to the simulated sunlight for a short period. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

TI Monte Carlo radiative transfer in protoplanetary disks
SO ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
AB Aims. We present a new continuum 3D radiative transfer code, MCFOST, based on a Monte-Carlo method. MCFOST can be used to calculate (i) monochromatic images in scattered light and/or thermal emission; (ii) polarisation maps; (iii) interferometric visibilities; (iv) spectral energy distributions; and (v) dust temperature distributions of protoplanetary disks.
   Methods. Several improvements to the standard Monte Carlo method are implemented in MCFOST to increase effeciency and reduce convergence time, including wavelength distribution adjustments, mean intensity calculations, and an adaptive sampling of the radiation field. The reliability and efficiency of the code are tested against a previously-defined benchmark, using a 2D disk configuration. No significant difference (no more than 10% and usually much less) is found between the temperatures and SEDs calculated by MCFOST and by other codes included in the benchmark.
   Results. A study of the lowest disk mass detectable by Spitzer, around young stars, is presented and the colours of "representative" parametric disks compared to recent IRAC and MIPS Spitzer colours of solar-like young stars located in nearby star-forming regions.

TI Synthesis of high quality zinc-blende CdSe nanocrystals and their
   application in hybrid solar cells
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Oleic acid (OA) modified zinc-blende cadmium selenium nanocrystals (NCs) with different diameters, 3-5 nm, have been prepared. We find that the morphology and fluorescent properties of the samples are related to the preparation conditions such as the chain-length and concentration of the cadmium precursor as well as the concentration of OA. The hybrid solar cells based on the obtained spherical CdSe NCs as an acceptor and Poly(2-methoxy-5-(2'-ethylhexoxy)-p-phenylenevinylene) (MEH-PPV) as a donor show an energy conversion efficiency (ECE) as high as 0.85%, three times higher than that reported before for spherical CdSe NCs/conjugated polymer hybrid solar cells. When poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is used as the donor phase instead of MEH-PPV, the energy conversion efficiency increases up to 1.08%. The solar cell based on CdSe NCs/conjugated polymer has the potential to open up new production technologies for hybrid solar cells based on semiconductor NCs.

TI Surface states, surface potentials, and segregation at surfaces of
   tin-doped In2O3
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Surfaces of In2O3 and tin-doped In2O3 (ITO) were investigated using photoelectron spectroscopy. Parts of the measurements were carried out directly after thin film preparation by magnetron sputtering without breaking vacuum. In addition samples were measured during exposure to oxidizing and reducing gases at pressures of up to 100 Pa using synchrotron radiation from the BESSY II storage ring. Reproducible changes of binding energies with temperature and atmosphere are observed, which are attributed to changes of the surface Fermi level position. We present evidence that the Fermi edge emission observed at ITO surfaces is due to metallic surface states rather than to filled conduction band states. The observed variation of the Fermi level position at the ITO surface with experimental conditions is accompanied by a large apparent variation of the core level to valence band maximum binding energy difference as a result of core-hole screening by the free carriers in the surface states. In addition segregation of Sn to the surface is driven by the surface potential gradient. At elevated temperatures the surface Sn concentration reproducibly changes with exposure to different environments and shows a correlation with the Fermi level position.

TI Ultrafast dynamics of charge carrier photogeneration and geminate
   recombination in conjugated polymer : fullerene solar cells
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We investigate the nature of ultrafast exciton dissociation and carrier generation in acceptor-doped conjugated polymers. Using a combination of two-pulse femtosecond spectroscopy with photocurrent detection, we compare the exciton dissociation and geminate charge recombination dynamics in blends of two conjugated polymers, MeLPPP [methyl-substituted ladder-type poly(p-phenylene)] and MDMO-PPV [poly(2-methoxy,5-(3,7-dimethyloctyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene], with the electron accepting fullerene derivative PCBM [1-(3-methoxycarbonyl)-propyl-1-phenyl-(6,6)C-61]. This technique allows us to distinguish between free charge carriers and Coulombically bound polaron pairs. Our results highlight the importance of geminate pair recombination in photovoltaic devices, which limits the device performance. The comparison of different materials allows us to address the dependence of geminate recombination on the film morphology directly at the polymer:fullerene interface. We find that in the MeLPPP:PCBM blend exciton dissociation generates Coulombically bound geminate polaron pairs with a high probability for recombination, which explains the low photocurrent yield found in these samples. In contrast, in the highly efficient MDMO-PPV:PCBM blend the electron transfer leads to the formation of free carriers. The anisotropy dynamics of electronic transitions from neutral and charged states indicate that polarons in MDMO-PPV relax to delocalized states in ordered domains within 500 fs. The results suggest that this relaxation enlarges the distance of carrier separation within the geminate pair, lowering its binding energy and favoring full dissociation. The difference in geminate pair recombination concurs with distinct dissociation dynamics. The electron transfer is preceded by exciton migration towards the PCBM sites. In MeLPPP:PCBM the exciton migration time decays smoothly with increasing PCBM concentration, indicating a trap-free exciton hopping. In MDMO-PPV:PCBM, however, the exciton migration time is found to show a threshold-like dependence on the PCBM concentration. This observation is explained by efficient interchain energy transfer in ordered MDMO-PPV domains in conjunction with exciton trapping.

TI Microbial mats as bioreactors: populations, processes, and products
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB Microbial mats are dynamic and complex ecosystems exhibiting spatial and temporal heterogeneity. The physical/chemical environment is typified by steep gradients and distinct microenvironments. These microenvironments support a great diversity of species with a wide range of metabolic processes. These processes often result in coupled reactions and biogeochemical cycles, and produce important end products such as trace gases and mineral precipitates. The latter can impact the composition and character of the sediment, imparting a "biosignature." These biosignatures can be preserved in the rock record and are useful in the interpretation of fossil record on Earth and possibly as an indication of life on other planetary bodies. The modem marine stromatolites of the Exuma Cays, Bahamas, provide an ideal system for studying the populations, processes, and products in a microbial ecosystem using a multidisciplinary approach. In order to acquire redox energy, microbial populations need to carry out metabolic reactions at rates faster than the equivalent chemical (abiotic) reactions. As such, microbes can be viewed as bioreactors that preferably oxidize carbon to CO2 to maximize the energy yield. The study of the microbial role in carbonate sedimentation and lithification in these stromatolites provides a picture of microbial mats as bioreactors producing a biosignature.

TI Multi-junction III-V solar cells: current status and future potential
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB Our recent R&D activities of III-V compound multi-junction (MJ) solar cells are presented. Conversion efficiency of InGaP/InGaAs/Ge has been improved up to 31-32% (AM 1.5) as a result of technologies development such as double hetero-wide band-gap tunnel junction, InGaP-Ge hetero-face structure bottom cell, and precise lattice-matching of InGaAs middle cell to Ge substrate by adding indium into the conventional GaAs layer. For concentrator applications, grid structure has been designed in order to reduce the energy loss due to series resistance, and world-record efficiency InGaP/InGaAs/Ge 3-junction concentrator solar cell with an efficiency of 37.4% (AM1.5G, 200-suns) has been fabricated. In addition, we have also demonstrated high-efficiency and large-area (7000 cm(2)) concentrator InGaP/InGaAs/Ge 3-junction solar cell modules of an outdoor efficiency of 27% as a result of developing high-efficiency InGaP/InGaAs/Ge 3-junction cells, low optical loss Fresnel lens and homogenizers, and designing high thermal conductivity modules.
   Future prospects are also presented. We have proposed concentrator III-V compound MJ solar cells as the 3rd generation solar cells in addition to 1st generation crystalline Si solar cells and 2nd generation thin-film solar cells. We are now developing low-cost and high output power concentrator MJ solar cell modules with an output power of 400 W/m(2) for terrestrial applications. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The role of magnetic reconnection in the observable features of solar
   eruptions
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB There are two competing classes of models for coronal mass ejections (CMEs): those that assume a preexisting magnetic flux rope and those that can make a flux rope during the eruption by magnetic reconnection. The present work is based on the model with a preexisting flux rope. We investigate the evolution of morphological features of the magnetic configuration in a CME according to a catastrophe model of flux rope CMEs developed previously. For the parameters chosen for the present work, roughly half of the total mass and magnetic flux are contained in the initial flux rope, while the remaining plasma and poloidal magnetic flux are brought by magnetic reconnection from the corona into the current sheet and from there into the CME bubble. These features and the corresponding physical processes are identical to those described by the non-flux rope models. Thus, the flux rope and non-flux rope models are less distinct than is generally assumed. The reconnected magnetic flux can account for the rapid expansion of the ejecta, and the plasma flowing out of the current sheet fills the outer shell of the ejecta. We tentatively identify the outer shell, the expanded bubble, and the flux rope with the leading edge, void, and core of the three-component CME structure, respectively. Thus, the final mass, speed, and magnetic energy-the quantities that determine the geoeffectiveness of the CME-are determined not in the initial eruption but during the CME expansion, at heights of a few solar radii. The aspects of this explanation that need improvement are also discussed.

TI Influence of soil moisture on boundary layer cloud development
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
AB The daytime interaction of the land surface with the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is studied using a coupled one-dimensional (column) land surface-ABL model. This is an extension of earlier work that focused on modeling the ABL for 31 May 1978 at Cabauw, Netherlands; previously, it was found that coupled land atmosphere tests using a simple land surface scheme did not accurately represent surface fluxes and coupled ABL development. Here, findings from that earlier study on ABL parameterization are utilized, and include a more sophisticated land surface scheme. This land surface scheme allows the land-atmosphere system to respond interactively with the ABL. Results indicate that in coupled land-atmosphere model runs, realistic daytime surface fluxes and atmospheric profiles are produced, even in the presence of ABL clouds (shallow cumulus). Subsequently, the role of soil moisture in the development of ABL clouds is explored in terms of a new relative humidity tendency equation at the ABL top where a number of processes and interactions are involved. Among other issues, it is shown that decreasing soil moisture may actually lead to an increase in ABL clouds in some cases.

The chemical reactor engineering, experimental setup, and test results are described. Maximum chemical conversion of CH4 to H-2 and C(gr) was 67% at 1600 K and 1 bar. Carbon formed was of nano-filamentary nature. The proposed solar hybrid chemical process conserves natural gas, reduces CO2 emissions, and provides a transition path to solar hydrogen.

TI Galactic cosmic ray transport in the global heliosphere
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
AB [1] We present a new axisymmetric model of the heliosphere that includes three principal particle species ( plasma with magnetic field, interstellar neutral atoms, and galactic cosmic rays). Unlike previous modulation models, which necessarily included a modulation boundary, we study the entry of the galactic cosmic rays into the heliosphere directly from the local interstellar medium population. An important improvement over previous global heliospheric models is that a kinetic description for the cosmic rays is used instead of the usual fluid approach. We compute the cosmic-ray diffusion coefficients from quasi-linear theory, assuming a constant ( but different) power spectrum of the fluctuations in both the solar wind and the interstellar medium. Our results show that low-energy particles are strongly attenuated by the magnetic wall in the inner heliosheath and do not reach the termination shock. The model predicts small cosmic rays gradients in most of the heliosphere, implying little modification to the termination and bow shocks. The exception is the inner heliosheath region, where cosmic-ray gradients are large and the energetic particles can, consequently, affect the plasma flow. Particle spectra in the inner heliosphere are found to be in agreement with the observations. We also find that the inner heliospheric galactic cosmic-ray population is not sensitive to the upwind-downwind asymmetry of the termination shock.

TI Effect of solar wind pressure pulses on the size and strength of the
   auroral oval
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
AB [1] It has recently been found that solar wind dynamic pressure changes can dramatically affect the precipitation of magnetospheric particles on the high-latitude ionosphere. We have examined the effect of large solar wind dynamic pressure increases on the location, size, and intensity of the auroral oval using particle precipitation data from Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) spacecraft. Three events have been selected for study during the time period after 1997 when four DMSP spacecraft (F11-F14) were simultaneously operational. Interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) orientation is different from event to event. For each event, we determine equatorward and poleward boundaries of the auroral oval before and after an increase in solar wind pressure. Also, using measured integral fluxes, we construct precipitating particle energy input maps for the auroral oval. All cases studied show a significant change of the auroral oval location, size, and intensity in response to the solar wind pressure pulse. Most prominent are an increase of the auroral zone width and a decrease of the polar cap size when the solar wind dynamic pressure increases under steady southward IMF conditions. An increase in total precipitating particle energy flux is also observed. A smaller response is seen when the IMF B-z has a simultaneous northward turning and when it is nearly zero before the pressure enhancement. Our results also point to significant differences between the auroral precipitation response to solar wind pressure changes and its response to isolated substorms, the former inducing a global auroral reaction while the latter is related to more localized premidnight disturbances. Auroral UV observations from the Polar spacecraft during our events are found to give results consistent with the results we get from the precipitating particle observations.

TI Partial shadowing of photovoltaic arrays with different system
   configurations: literature review and field test results
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB Partial shadowing has been identified as a main cause for reducing energy yield of grid-connected photovoltaic systems. The impact of the applied system configuration on the energy yield of partially shadowed arrays has been widely discussed. Nevertheless, there is still much confusion especially regarding the optimal grade of modularity for such systems. A 5-kWp photovoltaic system was installed at K.U. Leuven. The system consists of three independent subsystems: central inverter, string inverter, and a number of AC modules. Throughout the year, parts of the photovoltaic array are shadowed by vegetation and other surrounding obstacles. The dimensions of shadowing obstacles were recorded and the expectable shadowing losses were estimated by applying different approaches. Based on the results of almost 2 years of analytical monitoring, the photovoltaic system is assessed with regard to shadowing losses and their dependence on the chosen system configuration. The results indicate that with obstacles of irregular shape being close to the photovoltaic array, simulation estimates the shadowing losses rather imprecise. At array positions mainly suffering from a reduction of the visible horizon by obstacles far away from the photovoltaic array, a simulation returns good results. Significant differences regarding shadow tolerance of different inverter types or overproportional losses with long module strings could not be confirmed for the system under examination. The negative impact of partial shadowing on the array performance should not be underestimated, but it affects modular systems as well as central inverter systems. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Nanoflare statistics from first principles: Fractal geometry and
   temperature synthesis
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB We derive universal scaling laws for the physical parameters of flarelike processes in a low-beta plasma, quantified in terms of spatial length scales l, area A, volume V, electron density n(e), electron temperature T-e, total emission measure M, and thermal energy E. The relations are specified as functions of two independent input parameters, the power index a of the length distribution, N(l) proportional to l(-a), and the fractal Haussdor dimension D between length scales l and are areas, A(l) proportional to l(D). For values that are consistent with the data, i.e., a = 2.5 +/- 0.2 and D = 1.5 +/- 0.2, and assuming the RTV scaling law, we predict an energy distribution N(E) proportional to E-alpha with a power-law coefficient of alpha = 1.54 +/- 0.11. As an observational test, we perform statistics of nanoflares in a quiet-Sun region covering a comprehensive temperature range of T-e approximate to 1-4 MK. We detected nano are events in extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) with the 171 and 195 Angstrom filters from the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer ( TRACE), as well as in soft X-rays with the AlMg filter from the Yohkoh soft X-ray telescope (SXT), in a cospatial field of view and cotemporal time interval. The obtained frequency distributions of thermal energies of nanoflares detected in each wave band separately were found to have powerlaw slopes of alpha approximate to 1.86 +/- 0.07 at 171 Angstrom (T-e approximate to 0.7-1.1 MK), alpha approximate to 1.8 +/- 0.10 at 195 Angstrom (T-e approximate to 1.0-1.5 MK), and alpha approximate to 1.57 +/- 0.15 in the AlMg filter (T-e approximate to 1.8-4.0 MK), consistent with earlier studies in each wavelength. We synthesize the temperature-biased frequency distributions from each wavelength and find a corrected power-law slope of alpha approximate to 1.54 +/- 0.03, consistent with our theoretical prediction derived from first principles. This analysis, supported by numerical simulations, clearly demonstrates that previously determined distributions of nano flares detected in EUV bands produced a too steep power-law distribution of energies with slopes of alpha approximate to 2.0-2.3 mainly because of this temperature bias. The temperature-synthesized distributions of thermal nano are energies are also found to be more consistent with distributions of nonthermal are energies determined in hard X-rays (alpha approximate to 1.4-1.6) and with theoretical avalanche models (alpha approximate to 1.4-1.5).

TI High-resolution FUV spectroscopy of the terrestrial day airglow with the
   far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
AB During orbital verification the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer obtained spectra of the terrestrial day airglow between 905 and 1184 Angstrom from an altitude of 766 km. The spectrographs have three apertures chat call simultaneously record the atmospheric emissions with limiting instrumental spectral resolutions of approximately 0.4, 0.05, and 0.03 Angstrom. Seven orbits were obtained of observations of the sunlit Earth and disclose a wealth of emissions resulting from the electron impact excitation of N-2 in addition to emissions of O I, N I, and N II produced by both photoelectron impact and by photodestructive excitation and ionization of thermospheric O and N-2 by extreme ultraviolet solar radiation. The argon resonance transitions are unambiguously identified as are previously unreported transitions between highly excited energy levels of O+ These spectra have the highest spectral resolution and sensitivity in this spectral range to date and will provide valuable input to the interpretation of lower resolution spectra from current and future Earth remote sensing missions.

TI Modeling solar cell degradation in space: A comparison of the NRL
   displacement damage dose and the JPL equivalent fluence approaches
SO PROGRESS IN PHOTOVOLTAICS
AB The method for predicting solar cell degradation in space radiation environments developed recently at the US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) is compared in detail with the earlier method developed at the US Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Although both methods are similar, the key difference is that in the NRL approach, the energy dependence of the damage coefficients is determined from a calculation of the nonionizing energy loss (NIEL) and requires relatively few experimental measurements, whereas in the JPL method the damage coefficients have to be determined using an extensive set of experimental measurements. The end result of the NRL approach is a determination of a single characteristic degradation curve for a cell technology, which is measured against displacement damage dose rather than fluence, The end-of-life (EOL) cell performance for a particular mission can be read from the characteristic curve once the displacement damage dose for the mission has been determined In the JPL method, the end result is a determination of the equivalent I MeV electron fluence, which would cause the same level of degradation as the actual space environment. The two approaches give similar results for GaAs/Ge solar cells, for which a large database exists. Because the NRL method requires far less experimental data than the JPL method, it is more readily applied To emerging cell technologies for which extensive radiation measurements are not available. The NRL approach is being incorporated into a code named SAVANT by researchers at NASA Glenn Research Center. The predictions of SAVANT are shown to agree closely with actual space data for GaAs/Ge and CuInSe2 cells flown on the Equator-S mission, Published in 2001 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

CL BOULDER, CO
SP NASA, Jet Prop Lab, Galileo Project
AB A set of Hubble Space Telescope faint object camera images taken in the Hp bands near 1550 Angstrom is used to infer the morphological properties of the steady state Jovian FUV aurorae. We focus on issues best addressed using the excellent spatial resolution available after correction of the spherical aberration, i.e., those related to high latitude or small auroral features. A thorough comparison of the emission loci with model ovals highlights the improvement of the VIP4 magnetic field model over previous ones at all latitudes. The north-south conjugacy of the main oval is now correctly accounted for, and second-order discrepancies suggest non axially symmetric contributions of external origin. This oval is usually amazingly narrow (down to 80 +/- 50 km) and very bright, although quite variable with time (l00 kR to 1-2 MR, i.e., peak input flux of similar to 10-200 ergs cm(-2) s(-1)). We discuss its structure, in latitude and longitude, and show that it is consistent with precipitation by pitch angle scattering. Fainter concentric narrow ovals are also present on the north polar cap, presumably at the footprint of open field lines. Both polar caps are partly covered by a faint diffuse emission, confined to the afternoon sector in magnetic local time. A bright extended feature, previously identified across the north polar cap along the 160 degrees meridian, might be not a specific auroral feature but rather a region where inner arcs and diffuse polar cap emissions are intensified, maybe by a solar wind driven ionospheric process. Equatorward of the main oval, we identify a belt of moderate emission, attributed to a precipitation process distributed between the Io torus and the distant magnetosphere. Longitudinally confined bright areas lie in the same latitude range and consist of series of short segments of concentric arcs. We also present the discovery of a narrow faint oval at the footprint of Io's orbit. Finally, we confirm that the FUV footprints of the Io flux tube are very small (a few hundreds of kilometers or less), implying an interaction close to lo. The input energy flux in this spots is huge and variable (0.8-5 x 10(11) W).

TI Eco-thermodynamics: economics and the second law
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB The laws of physics, especially the first and second laws of thermodynamics, have significant implications for economic theory. The major implications of the First Law (conservation of mass/energy) are straightforward and have been discussed at length elsewhere. In brief, raw material inputs to economic processes are not 'consumed'. Having been extracted from the environment in the first place, they eventually return to the environment as wastes. The economic implications of the Second Law (entropy law) are far more subtle. There is considerable literature, initiated by the work of Georgescu-Roegen, on the supposed constraints on economic growth imposed by the fact that economic processes utilize 'low-entropy' raw materials (fossil fuels and high grade metal ores) and discard 'high entropy' wastes. However, as a practical matter the flux of available low-entropy energy (exergy) from the sun is extremely large and certainly adequate to sustain economic activity in the solar system indefinitely, even though fossil fuel and metal ore stocks may eventually be exhausted. It is argued in this paper that the real economic significance of the Second Law lies in the fact that exergy is: (i) not conserved; and (ii) is a useful common measure of resource quality, as well as quantity, applicable to both materials and energy. Thus, exergy can be used to measure and compare resource inputs and outputs, including wastes and losses. This is potentially important in itself. Moreover, since exergy is not conserved it is truly consumed (i.e. used up) in economic processes. Hence, exergy is no less a 'factor of production' than labor or capital. This fact has strong implications for economic growth theory, especially with regard to assessing the role of technical progress. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of CdCl2 processing on the physical and electro-optical properties of CdTe were evaluated for thin films produced by physical vapor deposition and close-spaced sublimation (CSS). Two substrates (CdS and Indium-tin-oxide) were used with the physical vapor deposition (PVD) films specifically to isolate the effects of the Cd(SxTe1-x) alloy formed during the treatment of films deposited on CdS. The samples were analyzed by x-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and photoluminescence. The observed changes in microstructure were caused by recrystallization, which consisted of the nucleation and development of a new CdTe structure and subsequent grain growth. Nevertheless, for these processes to take place, it was necessary that enough lattice-strain energy was available in the films; For this reason, PVD films did recrystallize, while CSS films did not. For the first time, recrystallization was observed directly in AFM images of CdTe films and confirmed by XRD analysis, which indicated the existence of two lattice parameters in PVD samples treated at 350 degrees C. For samples treated at 400 degrees C, the CdCl2 treatment improved the minority-carrier lifetime of the films by more than one order of magnitude. This improvement was attributed to the elimination of deep defect levels within the band gap of the CdTe films as a result of the treatment. The sulfur diffusion into CdTe films deposited on CdS, during the CdCl2 treatment at 400 degrees C, strongly affected the defect structure.

TI Rapid recovery of marine bacterioplankton activity after inhibition by
   UV radiation in coastal waters
SO APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB Laboratory and in situ experiments were performed in order to evaluate the role of W radiation on bacterial activity. Particular attention was given to the determination of the role of W-A and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) and different nutrient conditions on the recovery of bacterial activity. Laboratory experiments with nearly natural radiation intensities indicated a 20 to 40% reduction from the initial level of bacterial activity after W-B exposure for 2 to 4 h. Bacterial activity in freshly collected seawater showed a more pronounced inhibition and faster recovery than bacterial activity in aged, nutrient-depleted seawater. The results of in situ experiments with filtered water (0.8-mu m-pore-size filter) and natural surface solar radiation levels agreed with those of the laboratory experiments and revealed that W-A and PAR are important for the recovery of bacterial activity and result in levels of bacterial activity that are higher than those prior to exposure to full solar radiation. Bacterioplankton exposed to full solar radiation for 3 h and subsequently incubated at different depths within the upper mixed water column showed an increase in bacterial activity with increased depth; the highest bacterial activity was detected at depths of 5.5 to 10.5 m, where the short-wavelength W-B was already largely attenuated, but enough long wavelength W-A and short PAR were available to allow recovery, This elevated bacterial activity following exposure to UV-B was attributed to the photolysis of dissolved organic matter (DOM) exposed to near-surface radiation and to the rapid recovery of bacteria from UV stress once they were mixed into deeper layers of the upper mixed water column, where they efficiently utilize the photolytically cleaved DOM. It is concluded that studies on the role of W on the carbon and energy flux through the upper layer of the ocean should take into account the highly dynamic radiation conditions.

TI On the evolution of stars that form electron-degenerate cores processed
   by carbon burning .3. The inward propagation of a carbon-burning flame
   and other properties of a 9 M-circle dot model star
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB A 9 M. stellar model of Population I composition is evolved from the hydrogen-burning main sequence to the thermally pulsing ''super'' asymptotic giant branch stage, where it has an electron-degenerate core composed of an inner oxygen-neon (ONe) part of mass similar to 1.066 M. and an outer carbon-oxygen (GO) layer of mass similar to 0.05 M. and is experiencing thermal pulses driven by helium-burning thermonuclear flashes. The carbon-burning phase of the 9 M. model is in many respects similar to, but differs importantly from that of a 10 M. model studied earlier. In both cases, carbon is ignited off center, and a series of carbon flashes accompanied by a convective shell occur. In contrast to the 10 M. model, the 9 M. model experiences the second dredge-up phenomenon (the penetration of the base of the hydrogen-rich convective envelope inward into helium-and carbon-rich material) near the beginning rather than near the end of the carbon-burning phase. The first carbon-burning flash causes helium burning to shut down and the release of gravothermal energy (compressional and thermal energy) between the helium-carbon discontinuity and the base of the convective envelope plays a dominant role in the dredge-up event. Beginning with the third carbon-burning shell flash, the ''flame front,'' defined as being coincident with the base of the convective shell, propagates inward with a speed close to theoretical predictions that relate flame speed to local thermodynamic, opacity, and energy-generation rate characteristics. Ahead of the inward moving front, most of the nuclear energy released in a ''precursor flame'' goes into heating and expanding matter. As the precursor flame moves toward the center, its radial thickness decreases and, to follow the progress of the front with standard techniques, both the spatial grid size and the time step must be continually decreased. Following the front gives one the opportunity to ponder Zeno's paradox, which is averted because the thickness of the precursor flame remains finite. On reaching the center, the carbon-burning flame reverses direction and continues moving outward until it is within similar to 0.03 M. of the helium-burning shell. After carbon burning is completed, C-12 remains at a finite abundance throughout the electron-degenerate core of mass similar to 1.116 M. and is more abundant than Ne-20 in the outer similar to 0.05 M. of this core. Over most of the ONe interior of both the 9 and 10 M. models, Na-23 is more abundant than Mg-24: but th, maximum C-12 abundance in the 9 M. model ONe interior (X[C-12] similar to 0.048) is significantly larger than in the 10 M. model (X[C-12] similar to 0.012). For an ONe white dwarf that accretes enough matter to reach the Chandrasekhar limiting mass, this may make the difference between total explosive disruption (large C-12 abundance) and collapse to neutron-star dimensions (small C-12 abundance). The abundances in the CO part of the core have relevance for understanding the abundances in the ejecta of classical novae produced by massive ONe white dwarfs in close binaries. In the outer similar to 0.014 M. of the CO part of the core, the abundances of all neon isotopes are much less than solar, and Mg-25 and the neutron-rich isotopes made during the formation of Mg-25 are at a total abundance equal to the initial abundance of CNO elements in the model. As in the 10 M. case, thermal pulses occasioned by helium shell flashes begin after hydrogen is reignited and the carbon-burning luminosity drops below similar to 100 L..
   The time between pulses is similar to 400 yr, roughly twice as large as in the 10 M. model. After the ejection of the hydrogen-rich envelope as a planetary nebula, the remnant of the 9 M. model is expected to evolve into a white dwarf of mass similar to 1.15 M., the outer similar to 0.08 M. of which is composed of carbon and oxygen.

TI A new pathway for transmembrane electron transfer in photosynthetic
   reaction centers of Rhodobacter sphaeroides not involving the excited
   special pair
SO BIOCHEMISTRY
AB It is generally accepted that electron transfer in bacterial photosynthesis is driven by the first singlet excited state of a special pair of bacteriochlorophylls (P*). We have examined the first steps of electron transfer in a mutant of the Rhodobacter sphaeroides reaction center in which charge separation from P* is dramatically slowed down. The results provide for the first time clear evidence that excitation of the monomeric bacteriochlorophyll in the active branch of the reaction center (B-A) drives ultrafast transmembrane electron transfer without the involvement of P*, demonstrating a new and efficient mechanism for solar energy transduction in photosynthesis. The most abundant charge-separated intermediate state probably is P+BA-, which is formed within 200 fs from B-A* and decays with a lifetime of 6.5 ps into P+HA-. We also see evidence for the involvement of a BA+HA- state in the alternative pathway.

   high-energy, short-pulse carbon dioxide laser
SO ARCHIVES OF DERMATOLOGY
AB Background: Despite its growing use in dermatologic surgery, the effects of the high-energy, short-pulse carbon dioxide laser on human skin have not been well documented.
   Objectives: To study the histologic effects of this high-energy, short-pulse CO2 laser on human skin and to compare these changes with the effects of standard chemex-foliation procedures.
   Observations: Twenty-four hours after laser administration, there was extensive epidermal necrosis and coagulative change in the superficial papillary dermis. With increasing doses of laser energy, there was a statistically significant increase in the depth of dermal wounding (P<.001 for days 1 and 3, F-test). Reepithelialization occurred in most specimens by day 3. By day 90, most specimens showed a subepidermal dermal repair zone consisting of compact new collagen fibers overlying collagen with evidence of solar elastosis.
   Conclusions: This high-energy, short-pulse CO2 laser produces morphologic changes similar to those seen with medium-depth chemical peels. This laser can ablate skin precisely and bloodlessly with little interference in the wound healing process, suggesting that it may serve as an alternative treatment for photoaged skin.

TI MODEL DIELECTRIC FUNCTIONS FOR NATIVE OXIDES ON COMPOUND SEMICONDUCTORS
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Analytical models with eight parameters have been found which describe the dielectric functions of native or electrochemically grown oxide layers on the compound semiconductors GaP, GaAs, GaSb, InP, InAs, and InSb in the 1.6 to 5.6 eV photon energy range. These model functions agree with the experimental optical constants to within the accuracy of the measurements. They will be useful for the design and analysis of semiconductor laser structures, solar cells, and other electro-optical devices.

TI THE COSMIC-RADIATION IN THE HELIOSPHERE AT SUCCESSIVE SOLAR MINIMA
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
AB Comparative cosmic ray studies at the time of successive solar minima are of special importance in establishing the relative role of large-scale drift effects in the modulation process and in estimating the size of the modulation region and the local interstellar spectra of low- and medium-energy cosmic rays.  In this paper the 1 AU cosmic ray observations are compared for the last three solar minimum periods along with the 1977/1978 and 1987 Pioneer 10 and Voyager 1 and 2 data from the outer heliosphere.  There is good agreement between the 1965 and 1987 galactic cosmic ray H and He spectra at 1 AU.  However, there are significant and complex differences between the 1977/1978 and 1987 measurements of the galactic and anomalous cosmic ray components at 1 and 15 AU.  In the outer heliosphere there are large negative latitudinal gradients that reach their maximum magnitude when the inclination of the outer heliosphere current sheet is at a minimum.  The radial gradients decrease with heliocentric distance as approximately 1/r0.7 and do not differ significantly at the successive solar minima.  While these effects, along with the shift in the intensity maximum of anomalous helium (He+), are in the direction expected from large-scale gradient and curvature drifts in the heliosphere, they are about an order of magnitude smaller than those calculated using the standard Parker model of the interplanetary magnetic field.  The measured radial and latitudinal gradients are used to estimate the particle transport parameters in the outer heliosphere.  The slope of the H spectra measured at Pioneer 10 for both solar minimum periods is given by gamma(II) approximately 0.5 down to energies of 40 McV.  Using the local interstellar He spectrum of Webber et al. (1987), it is estimated that the modulation boundary is of the order of 160 AU.

SO NANO LETTERS
AB An experimental study of the influence of gold nanoparticles on a alpha-Fe2O3 photoanodes for photoelectrochemical water splitting is described. A relative enhancement in the water splitting efficiency at photon frequencies corresponding to the plasmon resonance in gold was observed. This relative enhancement was observed only for electrode geometries with metal particles that were localized at the semiconductor-electrolyte interface consistent with the observation that minority carrier transport to the electrolyte is the most significant impediment to achieving high efficiencies in this system.

TI Effect of Anchoring Group on Electron Injection and Recombination
   Dynamics in Organic Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB In the field of dye-sensitized solar cells, the number of different sensitizing dyes is increasing rapidly. To produce low-cost dyes, much work is being directed toward synthesizing all-organic, ruthenium-free dyes with high extinction coefficients and broad absorption bands with large solar spectrum overlap. One of the best dyes, the polyene-diphenylaniline dye D5L2A1, has a rather blue absorption with an IPCE onset at around 650 nm, but it still has an energy conversion efficiency of almost 6%. To increase the overlap with the solar spectrum, the cyanoacrylic acid anchoring group was changed to rhodanine-3-acetic acid in complex D5L2A3. This gave an IPCE onset at around 750 nm, but unfortunately, it also decreased the overall efficiency to a modest 1.7%. By femtosecond transient absorption, we show that the electron injections into TiO(2) for the two dyes are ultrafast and indistinguishable with our time resolution (< 200 fs). However, charge recombination is also ultrafast, with different fractions of a ca. 500-fs component for the two dyes. Yet, the fraction of the faster decay component is larger for D5L2A3 than for D5L2A1. Here, we provide an interpretation of the implications of changing anchoring group. We believe that a lack of electron density oil the binding oxygens of the D5L2A3 LUMO, due to the rhodanine group, promotes a higher probability for electron injection to short-lived surface trap states compared to the situation for the fully conjugated D5L2A1.

TI Modeling of outer radiation belt electrons by multidimensional diffusion
   process
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
AB In this study, we develop a new code which uses a hybrid finite difference (HFD) method to solve a 2-D bounce-averaged energy-pitch angle diffusion equation in the outer radiation belts. We implement the numerical algorithm by adopting a split operator technique, an implicit scheme for dealing with diagonal diffusion coefficients, and an alternative direction implicit scheme for off-diagonal (or cross) diffusion coefficients. We show that our code HFD can successfully overcome the unstable problem when the large and rapidly varying cross diffusion coefficients are included. Particularly, we examine whether resonant interactions with obliquely propagated whistler mode chorus and hiss waves result in a net acceleration or loss of relativistic electrons in the outer radiation belt L=4.5. Numerical simulations show that chorus waves can yield significant acceleration of relativistic electrons, while hiss waves are primarily responsible for scattering equatorially mirroring electrons toward the loss cone.

TI Energy-storage technologies and electricity generation
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB As the contribution of electricity generated from renewable sources (wind, wave and solar) grows, the inherent intermittency of supply from such generating technologies must be addressed by a step-change in energy storage. Furthermore, the continuously developing demands of contemporary applications require the design of versatile energy-storage/power supply systems offering wide ranges of power density and energy density. As no single energy-storage technology has this capability, systems will comprise combinations of technologies such as electrochemical supercapacitors, flow batteries, lithium-ion batteries, superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) and kinetic energy storage. The evolution of the electrochemical supercapacitor is largely dependent on the development of optimised electrode materials (tailored to the chosen electrolyte) and electrolytes. Similarly, the development of lithium-ion battery technology requires fundamental research in materials science aimed at delivering new electrodes and electrolytes. Lithium-ion technology has significant potential, and a step-change is required in order to promote the technology from the portable electronics market into high-duty applications. Flow-battery development is largely concerned with safety and operability. However, opportunities exist to improve electrode technology yielding larger power densities. The main barriers to overcome with regard to the development of SMES technology are those related to high-temperature superconductors in terms of their granular, anisotropic nature. Materials development is essential for the successful evolution of flywheel technology. Given the appropriate research effort, the key scientific advances required in order to successfully develop energy-storage technologies generally represent realistic goals that may be achieved by 2050.

TI Nitrogen complex species and its chemical nature in TiO2 for

SO CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB A photocatalyst with high reactivity under visible-light has been desired to utilize solar irradiation or interior lighting efficiently. Nitrogen-doped TiO2 revealed significant improvement in optical absorption and photocatalytic activity over TiO2 under visible light. We have performed the first-principles calculations to study the detailed N complex species introduced in TiO2. The results include stable geometries, densities of states, formation energies, and core levels. The present systematic studies account for the long-term controversial issue on N-doped TiO2, in particular, regarding the detailed assignment of N Is binding energies observed in the XPS measurement. The detailed analyses of the formation energies show that introducing the N species more in a controlled way via process conditions is crucial to achieve the optimized photocatalytic performance.

   cells
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The role of bathocuproine (BCP) buffer layer inserted between active layer and Al contact in photovoltaic cells based on phthalocyanine (Pc) and C-60 was investigated. Photoluminescence (PL) experiments show exciton quenching at the C-60-Al interface to be strongly reduced by inserting BCP. Current-voltage characteristics of photovoltaic cells with planar geometry front electrode/Pc/C-60/BCP/Al show that BCP dramatically improves electron transport out of the C-60 film into the Al electrode. The tenfold increase in power conversion efficiency (eta) with BCP can mostly be attributed to the latter effect. BCP does not improve eta in photovoltaic cells with blend film geometry front electrode/Pc:C-60/Al. (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics.

TI Light-driven hydrogen production by a hybrid complex of a
   [NiFe]-hydrogenase and the cyanobacterial photosystem I
SO PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY
AB In order to generate renewable and clean fuels, increasing efforts are focused on the exploitation of photosynthetic microorganisms for the production of molecular hydrogen from water and light. In this study we engineered a 'hard-wired' protein complex consisting of 9 hydrogenase and photosystem I (hydrogenase-PSI complex) as a direct light-to-hydrogen conversion system. The key component was an artificial fusion protein composed of the membrane-bound [NiFe] hydrogenase from the beta-proteobacterium Ralstonia eutropha H16 and the peripheral PSI subunit PsaE of the cyanobacterium Thermosy-nechococcus elongatus. The resulting hydrogenase-PsaE fusion protein associated with PsaE-free PSI spontaneously, thereby forming a hydrogenase-PSI complex as confirmed by sucrose-gradient ultracentrifuge and immunoblot analysis. The hydrogenase-PSI complex displayed light-driven hydrogen production at a rate of 0.58 mu mol H-2 center dot mg chlorophyll(-1)center dot h(-1). The complex maintained its accessibility to the native electron acceptor ferredoxin. This study provides the first example of a light-driven enzymatic reaction by an artificial complex between a redox enzyme and photosystem I and represents an important step on the way to design a photosynthetic organism that efficiently converts solar energy and water into hydrogen.

TI Life cycle assessment of hydrogen fuel cell and gasoline vehicles
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB A life cycle assessment of hydrogen and gasoline vehicles, including fuel production and utilization in vehicles powered by fuel cells and internal combustion engines, is conducted to evaluate and compare their efficiencies and environmental impacts. Fossil fuel and renewable technologies are investigated, and the assessment is divided into various stages.
   Energy efficiencies and greenhouse gas emissions are evaluated in each step for crude oil and natural gas pipeline transportation, crude oil distillation and natural gas reformation, wind and solar electricity generation, hydrogen production through water electrolysis, and gasoline and hydrogen distribution and utilization.
   The results indicate that, when taking into account fossil fuel energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, the efficiency of a fuel cell vehicle employing hydrogen from natural gas should be at least 25-30% higher than a gasoline one to be competitive.
   Wind electricity generation to produce hydrogen via electrolysis, and its application in a PEMFC vehicle, has the lowest greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuel energy consumption. However, the economic attractiveness of renewable wind technology is shown to depend significantly on the ratio in costs between hydrogen and natural gas; when this ratio is 2:1, a financial investment to produce hydrogen via natural gas is about five times more profitable than to do so via wind energy.

SO JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY A-CHEMISTRY

CY JUL   25, 2003
CL Nara, JAPAN
AB Nanocrystalline titania containing nanotube structure (TiNT) was synthesized by surfactant-assisted templating mechanism using tetraisopropyl orthotitanate (TIPT) modified with acethylacetone (ACA)/laurylamine hydrochloride (LAHC). The electrode of dye-sensitized solar cell using TiNT exhibited higher short-circuit photocurrent density (J(sc)) and solar energy conversion efficiency (eta) than that of P25 titania electrode in thin film region. To obtain highly efficient cell, the thickness of TiNT electrode must be increased to attain high amount of dye. Blending TiNT gel with P25 was proved to be effective way for increasing the thickness. Increasing amount of P25 more than 5% decreased the J(sc) of solar cells. However, TiNT + 2% P25 was the most suitable composition to obtain well-balanced properties. The open-circuit voltage (V-oc) and fill factor (ff) of the cell decreased with increasing thickness of the electrode due to increasing electron recombination and series resistance of the cell. The solar energy conversion efficiency (eta) of 8.43% with a J(sc) of 18.1 mA cm(-2), a V-oc of 0.72 V and a ff of 0.642 was attained by using TiNT + 2% P25 electrode with 8.2 mum film thickness.

TI Chemical diffusion coefficient of electrons in nanostructured
   semiconductor electrodes and dye-sensitized solar cells
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B
AB The properties and physical interpretation of the electron diffusion coefficient, D-n, observed in nanostructured semiconductors and dye-sensitized solar cells by small perturbation electrical and electrooptical techniques are investigated. The chemical diffusion coefficient is defined as the product of a thermodynamic factor (that accounts for the effect of nonideal statistics in a gradient of chemical potential) and a jump diffusion coefficient (that depends on average hopping distances and rates). The thermodynamic and kinetic similarities, as well as the differences, between interacting ions in the lattice and electrons in nanostructured semiconductors are discussed. From these considerations, the chemical diffusion coefficient of electrons for multiple trapping transport in nanoporous dye solar cells can be calculated indirectly, and the results are in agreement with the reduction of the kinetic-tran sport equations in the quasistatic approximation. The chemical diffusion coefficient in several models for electrons is discussed: for a wide but stationary distribution of sites energies, giving the Fermi-level dependent D-n [Fisher et al. J. Phys. Chein. B 2000, 104, 949] and for the enhancement of the diffusivity by effect of electrostatic shift of energy levels [Vanmaekelbergh et al. J. Phys. Chein. B 1999, 103, 747]. This last model is shown to correspond to the mean-field approximation to interaction in a lattice gas. A general expression containing all of these cases is provided, and several important consequences of the distinction between macroscopic diffusion and single particle random walk are pointed out.

AB In support of the World Climate Research Program GEWEX Continental-Scale International Project (GCIP) and the GEWEX Americas Prediction Project (GAPP), real-time estimates of shortwave radiative fluxes, both at the surface and at the top of the atmosphere, are being produced operationally by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service using observations from GOES images. The inference scheme has been developed at the Department of Meteorology, University of Maryland, and the atmospheric and surface model input parameters are produced and provided by the NOAA/National Centers for Environmental Prediction. The radiative fluxes are being evaluated on hourly, daily, and monthly timescales using observations at about 50 stations. The satellite estimates have been found to be within acceptable limits during snow-free periods, but the difficulty in detecting clouds over snow affects the accuracy during the winter season. In what follows, this activity is discussed, and evaluation results of the derived fluxes against ground observations for time periods of 1-2 years are presented.

TI Modeling shock-accelerated solar energetic particles coupled to
   interplanetary Alfven waves
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB We present an idealized model simulating the coupled evolution of the distributions of multispecies shock-accelerated energetic ions and interplanetary Alfven waves in gradual solar energetic particle (SEP) events. Particle pitch-angle diffusion coefficients are expressed in terms of wave intensities, and wave growth rates in terms of momentum gradients of SEP distributions, by the same quasilinear theory augmented with resonance broadening. The model takes into consideration various physical processes: for SEPs, particle motion, magnetic focusing, scattering by Alfven waves, solar wind convection, and adiabatic deceleration; for the waves, WKB transport and amplification by streaming SEPs. Shock acceleration is heuristically represented by continuous injection of prescribed spectra of SEPs at a moving shock front. We show the model predictions for two contrasting sets of SEP source spectra, fast weakening and softening in one case and long lasting and hard in the other. The results presented include concurrent time histories of multispecies SEP intensities and elemental abundance ratios, as well as sequential snapshots of the following: SEP intensity energy spectra, Alfven wave spectra, particle mean free paths as functions of rigidity, and spatial profiles of SEP intensities and mean free paths. Wave growth plays a key role in both cases, although the magnitude of the wave growth differs greatly, and quite different SEP abundance variations are obtained. In these simulations, the maximum wave growth rate is large, but small relative to the wave frequency, and everywhere the total wave magnetic energy density remains small relative to that of the background magnetic field. The simulations show that, as the energetic protons stream outward, they rapidly amplify the ambient Alfven waves, by several orders of magnitude in the inner heliosphere. Energetic minor ions find themselves traveling through resonant Alfven waves previously amplified by higher velocity protons. The nonuniformly growing wave spectra alter the rigidity dependence of particle scattering, resulting in complex time variations of SEP abundances at large distances from the Sun. The greatly amplified waves travel outward in an expanding and weakening "shell," creating an expanding and falling "reservoir" of SEPs with. at spatial intensity profiles behind, while in and beyond the shell the intensities drop steeply. The wave-particle resonance relation dynamically links the evolving characteristics of the SEP and Alfven wave distributions in this new mode of SEP transport. We conclude that wave amplification, the counterpart to the scattering of streaming particles required by energy conservation, plays an essential role in the transport of SEPs in gradual SEP events. The steep proton-amplified wave spectra just upstream of the shock suggest that they may also be important in determining the elemental abundances of shock-accelerated SEP sources.

TI Supersymmetric seesaw mechanism without singlet neutrinos: Neutrino
   masses and lepton-flavor violation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We consider the supersymmetric seesaw mechanism induced by the exchange of heavy SU(2)(W) triplet states, rather than "right-handed" neutrino singlets, to generate neutrino masses. We show that in this scenario the neutrino flavor structure tested at low-energy in the atmospheric and solar neutrino experiments is directly inherited from the neutrino Yukawa couplings to the triplets. This allows us to predict the ratio of the tau-->mugamma (or tau-->egamma) and mu-->egamma decay rates in terms of the low-energy neutrino parameters. Moreover, once the model is embedded in a grand unified model, quark-flavor violation can be linked to lepton-flavor violation.

This underground site, with its large overburden of 2700 mw.e., is conveniently located at a distance of 150-210 km to several Japanese nuclear power stations. A measurement of the flux and energy spectrum of the electron anti-neutrinos, emitted by those reactors, will allow us to test the Large Mixing Angle Solution of the solar neutrino anomaly by performing a disappearance search for anti-neutrino oscillations. We will hence, for the first time, provide a completely solar model independent test of this particle physics solution of the solar neutrino problem. Data taking is expected to commence in 2001.

AB The production of H-2 gas from water and sunlight using microalgae, 'biophotolysis', has been a subject of applied research since the early 1970s. A number of approaches have been investigated, but most proved to have fundamental limitations or require unpredictable research breakthroughs. Examples are processes based on nitrogen-fixing microalgae and those producing H-2 and O-2 simultaneously from water ('direct biophotolysis'). The most plausible processes for future applied R & D are those which couple separate stages of microalgal photosynthesis and fermentations ('indirect biophotolysis'). These involve fixation of CO2 into storage carbohydrates followed by their conversion to H-2 by the reversible hydrogenase, both in dark and possibly light-driven anaerobic metabolic processes. Based on a preliminary engineering and economic analysis, biophotolysis processes must achieve close to an overall 10% solar energy conversion efficiency to be competitive with alternatives sources of renewable H-2, such as photovoltaic-electrolysis processes. Such high solar conversion efficiencies in photosynthetic CO2 fixation could be reached by genetically reducing the number of light harvesting (antenna) chlorophylls and other pigments in microalgae. Similarly, greatly increased yields of H-2 from dark fermentation by microalgae could be obtained through application of the techniques of metabolic engineering. Another challenge is to scale-up biohydrogen processes with economically viable bioreactors. Solar energy driven microalgae processes for biohydrogen production are potentially large-scale, but also involve long-term and economically high-risk R&D. In the nearer-term, it may be possible to combine microalgal H-2 production with wastewater treatment.

AB To meet the challenges of the emerging information-rich society, landscape ecology must become a holistic problem-solving oriented science by joining the transdisciplinary scientific revolution with a paradigm shift from conventional reductionistic and mechanistic approaches to holistic and organismic approaches of wholeness, connectedness and ordered complexity. Its central holistic concept is the Total Human Ecosystem as the highest level of co-evolutionary complexity in the global ecological hierarchy, with solar energy powered biosphere and fossil energy powered technosphere landscapes as its concrete systems. Landscape ecology could contribute to their structural and functional integration into a coherent sustainable ecosphere and thereby to the establishment of a sustainable balance between attractive and productive biosphere landscapes and healthy and livable technosphere landscapes for this and future generation. By utilizing new insights in self-organization of autopioetic systems and their cross-catalytic networks in the Total Human Ecosystem for synergistic benefits of the people, their economy and landscapes, such holistic landscape ecology together with other mission-driven transdisciplinary environmental sciences could serve as a catalyst for the urgently needed post-industrial symbiosis between nature and human society. This would ensure also their further biological and cultural evolution. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI On measuring and modeling energy fluxes above the floor of a homogeneous
   and heterogeneous conifer forest
SO AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB Information on mass and energy exchange at the soil surface under vegetation is a critical component of micrometeorological, climate, biogeochemical and hydrological models. Under sparse boreal and western conifer forests as much as 50% of incident solar energy reaches the soil surface. How this energy is partitioned into evaporating soil moisture, heating the air and soil remains a topic of scientific inquiry, as it is complicated by such factors as soil texture, litter, soil moisture, available energy, humidity deficits and turbulent mixing.
   Fluxes of mass and energy near the forest floor of a temperate ponderosa pine and a boreal jack pine stand were evaluated with eddy covariance measurements and a micrometeorological soil/plant/atmosphere exchange model. Field tests showed that the eddy covariance method is valid for studying the mean behavior of mass and energy exchange below forest canopies. On the other hand, large shade patches and sunflecks, along with the intermittent nature of atmospheric turbulence, cause run-to-run variability of mass and energy exchange measurements to be large.
   In general, latent heat flux densities are a non-linear function of available energy when the forest floor is dry. Latent heat Bur densities (lambda E) are about one-quarter of available energy, when this energy is below 100 W m(-2). Latent heat flux density (lambda E) peaks at about 35 W m(-2) when available energy exceeds this threshold. A diagnosis of measurements with a canopy micrometeorological model indicates that the partitioning of solar energy into sensible, latent and soil heat flux is affected by atmospheric thermal stratification, surface wetness and the thickness of the litter layer.

TI Effects of a high-density plasma sheet on ring current development
   during the November 2-6, 1993, magnetic storm
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
AB The growth and recovery of the November 2-6, 1993 magnetic storm was simulated using a drift-loss ring current model that was driven by dynamic fluxes at geosynchronous orbit as an outer boundary condition. During the storm main phase, a high-density plasma sheet was observed by the Los Alamos National Laboratory geosynchronous satellites to move into and flow around the inner magnetosphere over a period of similar to 12 hours [Borovsky et al., 1997; this issue] during the storm main phase. Densities at the leading edge of this structure reached 3 cm(-3) as compared with more typical values <1 cm-3. The factor of 3 change in the plasma sheet density from quiet to active times produced a factor of 3 enhancement in the strength of the simulated ring current. In addition, a short-timescale recovery in the Dst index at 1600 UT on November 4 was driven by changes in the outer boundary condition and appeared even in the absence of collisional losses. An overshoot in the minimum Dst* occurred in the simulated ring current compared with observed values at similar to 0200 UT on November 4 and is taken as evidence of a loss process not included in the ring current-atmosphere interaction model (RAM). The storm onset was associated with a compression of the entire dayside magnetopause to within geostationary orbit starting at 2307 UT and continuing for a half hour. It is suggested that a possible additional loss may have resulted as ions drifted to the compressed dayside magnetopause. In fact such losses were found in another simulation of the inner magnetosphere for the same storm by Freeman et al. [1996]. The energy supplied to the inner magnetosphere, relative to the total energy input during this magnetic storm, was examined by comparing two widely used energy input functions, the epsilon parameter [Akasofu, 1981] and the F parameter [Burton et al., 1975] against energy input to the ring current model based on geosynchronous plasma observations at the outer boundary. It is found that the epsilon parameter [Akasofu,1981] overestimates the ring current energy input compared to the drift-loss model by almost an order of magnitude during the main phase. However, the integrated energy input from epsilon, over the 4 day interval of the storm, is in very good agreement with the total energy input inferred from observations. On the other hand, F more closely approximates the magnitude of the ring current energy input alone as calculated in the drift-loss model. An energy budget is constructed for the storm that shows energy inputs from the solar wind and energy dissipation due to ring current buildup and decay, auroral electron precipitation, Joule heating, ion precipitation, and energy storage in the magnetotail in reasonable balance. The ring current energy input accounts for only 15% of the total dissipated energy in this storm interval. A more complete energy budget that extends to November 11,1993, was compiled by Knipp et al. [this issue].

TI Estimating the spatial distribution of snow in mountain basins using
   remote sensing and energy balance modeling
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
AB We present a modeling approach that couples information about snow cover duration from remote sensing with a distributed energy balance model to calculate the spatial distribution of snow water equivalence (SWE) in a 1.2 km(2) mountain basin at the peak of the accumulation season. In situ measurements of incident solar radiation, incident longwave radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed were distributed around the basin on the basis of topography. Snow surface albedo was assumed to be spatially constant and to decrease with time. Distributed snow surface temperature was estimated as a function of modeled air temperature. We computed the energy balance for each pixel at hourly intervals using the estimated radiative fluxes and bulk-aerodynamic turbulent-energy flux algorithms from a snowpack energy and mass balance model. Fractional snow cover within each pixel was estimated from three multispectral images (Landsat thematic mapper), one at peak accumulation and two during snowmelt, using decision trees and a spectral mixture model; from these we computed snow cover duration at subpixel resolution. The total cumulative energy for snowmelt at each remote sensing date was weighted by the fraction of each pixel's area that lost its snow cover by that date to determine an initial SWE for each pixel. We tested the modeling approach in the well-studied Emerald Lake basin in the southern Sierra Nevada. With no parameter fitting the modeled spatial pattern of SWE and the mean basin SWE agreed with intensive field survey data. As the modeling approach requires only a remote sensing time series and an ability to estimate the energy balance over the model domain, it should prove useful for computing SWE distributions at peak accumulation over larger areas, where extensive field measurements of SWE are not practical.

Scientific goals are presented and a technical description is provided of the two sensors and the common data processing unit. Calibration results are presented which show the ability of LION to separate electrons from protons and the ability of EPHIN to obtain energy spectra and achieve isotope separation for light nuclei.

TI AN EMPIRICAL DETERMINATION OF THE POLYTROPIC INDEX FOR THE
   FREE-STREAMING SOLAR-WIND USING HELIOS-1 DATA
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
AB Observations of solar wind proton temperatures indicate that the solar wind is heated as it moves outward toward the orbit of Earth. This heating, which may be the result of electron heat conduction and perhaps MHD waves, has proven difficult to quantify and hence is often neglected in MHD models of the solar wind. An alternate approach to finding explicit heating terms for the MHD energy equation is to use a polytropic approximation. This paper discusses the properties of the polytropic approximation and its application to the solar wind plasma. By using data from the Hellos 1 spacecraft, an empirical value for the polytropic index of the free-streaming solar wind is determined. Various corrections to the data are made to account for velocity gradients, nonuniformity in radial sampling, and stream interaction regions. The polytropic index, as derived from proton data, is found to be independent of speed state, within statistical error, and has an average value of 1.46. If magnetic pressure is included, the polytropic index has an average value of 1.58.

TI THE PROPER MOTION OF NETWORK BRIGHT POINTS AND THE HEATING OF THE SOLAR
   CORONA
SO ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
AB Since it has been proved that acoustic waves are inefficient, it has been widely accepted that the solar corona is heated by waves which propagate along magnetic flux tubes and are generated by the turbulent granular motions. Such motions, however, have not yet been measured nor the involved energy evaluated.
   We present in this paper the first measurements of the proper motion of the footpoints of magnetic flux tubes, at the photospheric level, outside active regions. For this purpose, we have used a high resolution granulation movie obtained at the Pic du Midi Observatory, in which we were able to identify many network bright points (NBPs). As they are associated to the magnetic flux tubes, we have used these tiny bright points as tracers of magnetic fields. Velocity histograms have been derived. They show that NBPs proper motion is turbulent in nature and that its mean speed is 1.4 km s-1. Velocities as large as 3 km s-1 have been measured. Using then the number density of NBPs derived by Muller & Roudier (1984) 200/100'' x 100'', it has been possible to calculate the energy flux which can be carried toward the corona, using an expression recently published by Choudhuri et al. (1993a). This flux appears to be about one order of magnitude larger than is necessary. Actually, the wave flux should even be much larger than that, if we keep in mind that the magnetic flux visible as NBPs, represents only a fraction of the total magnetic flux really present in the photosphere, outside active regions.
   We conclude that the solar corona may really be heated by waves which propagate along magnetic flux tubes rooted in the photosphere, and shaken by granular motions. The propagation of these waves along flux tubes needs however to be understood better.

AB In our work with the phthalocyanines and perylenes, we have formulated a hierarchy of placement of dyes in p-n heterojunction devices to optimize the short-circuit current density. Computer modeling of Schottky barrier cells, with parameters fit to experimental results and incorporating field-dependent carrier generation, were used to optimize the power efficiency. The model predicts an optimum carrier concentration density and suggests different hierarchies for utilization of Forster radiationless energy transfer. Synthesis and purification of materials is also discussed. In terms of purity, most materials used in the literature are shown to have been quite below solar grade. A newly devised purification technique is introduced. A hydration mechanism is shown to exist for chloroaluminum phthalocyanine, previously thought immune to hydration. The latter mechanism had been mistaken before for a simple phase transformation and can be induced by various different treatments with organic nonsolvents for chloroaluminum phthalocyanine. Testing of p-n and Schottky barrier cells is also discussed. The different capacitance versus voltage (C-V) spectroscopies are compared, and the case for the small-signal method is argued over the triangular voltage sweep. Several cautions on the interpretation of the C- V curves are noted.

TI EVIDENCE FOR MAGNETIC RECONNECTION IN SOLAR-FLARES
SO ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
AB From a study of the magnetic field topology in an active region, evidence is derived that solar flares are produced by magnetic reconnection. We study a complex group with two active regions (AR 2511 and AR 2512) for three consecutive days, June 13-15 1980. The observed longitudinal magnetic field is used to model the coronal magnetic field by the potential field created by a series of magnetic charges. This computed field matches satisfactorily the Halpha fibrils and the observed transverse field direction. A set of flares occurs principally in the northern group (AR 2511). During these three days, two different magnetic configurations in succession are responsible for the occurrence of these flares: first the intrusion of a new opposite flux in the following polarity, secondly the emergence of new flux between the main polarities. In this last case flares occurred, although the emerging bipole is almost parallel to the main bipole. We show that even in this bipolar configuration a separator is present and that observed Halpha flare ribbons are located near the intersection of the computed separatrices with the photosphere. This provides strong support to a model where reconnection releases the stored magnetic energy. The induced evolution of the magnetic field forces reconnection along others separators. They are connected by magnetic field lines to fainter kernels.

TI A MULTICOMPONENT PCM WALL OPTIMIZED FOR PASSIVE SOLAR HEATING
SO ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB The use of phase change materials (PCMs) for short-term heat storage in direct-gain passive solar applications is discussed.  Approximate formulae are presented for optimum phase change temperature and the thickness of a PCM wall.  Numerical simulations based on the Test Meteorological Years of Helsinki, Finland (60-degrees-N) and Madison, Wisconsin (43-degrees-N) indicate that a phase change temperature of 1-3-degrees-C above the average room temperature would yield optimal diurnal heat storage results.  A desired phase change point can be accurately obtained by using fatty acids and their mixtures.  To ease the installation, PCMs can be impregnated into conventional construction materials such as plasterboard.  The thermal performance of a PCM wall in the direct-gain room in a residential application was briefly studied through hourly simulations.  According to conservative estimates, direct energy savings of 5-20% could be expected, depending on climate.  As this may not always be adequate for economic cost-effectiveness, the effect of increased thermal comfort plays also a key role in evaluating the total benefits of PCMs storage.

AB The present review rationalizes the information spread in the literature concerning the use and role of buffer layers in polymer solar cells. Usual device structures include buffer layers, both at the anode and at the cathode interface, mainly to favour charge collection and extraction, but also to improve the device's overall performance. Buffer layers are actually essential for achieving highly efficient polymer solar cells and can no more be considered as "optional", thus the need and importance of understanding their properties and role. The aim of this review is to give the reader an overview of this topic and to provide a practical and useful tool for the daily activities of researchers in the field of polymer photovoltaics.

TI Toward a deterministic model of planetary formation. V. Accumulation
   near the ice line and super-earths
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB We address two outstanding issues in the sequential accretion scenario for gas giant planet formation, the retention of dust grains in the presence of gas drag and that of cores despite type I migration. The efficiency of these processes is determined by the disk structure. Theoretical models suggest that planets form in protostellar disk regions with an inactive neutral "dead zone'' near the midplane, sandwiched together by partially ionized surface layers where magnetorotational instability is active. Due to a transition in the abundance of dust grains, the active layer's thickness decreases abruptly near the ice line. Over a range of modest accretion rates (similar to 10(-9) to 10(-8) M-circle dot yr(-1)), the change in the angular momentum transfer rate leads to local surface density and pressure distribution maxima near the ice line. The azimuthal velocity becomes super-Keplerian and the grains accumulate in this transition zone. This barrier locally retains protoplanetary cores and enhances the heavy-element surface density to the critical value needed to initiate efficient gas accretion. It leads to a preferred location and epoch of gas giant formation. We simulate and reproduce the observed frequency and mass-period distribution of gas giants around solar-type stars without having to greatly reduce the type I migration strength. The mass function of the short-period planets shows an enhanced population of super-Earths relative to hot Jupiters, and it can be utilized to calibrate the efficiency of type I migration and to extrapolate the fraction of stars with habitable terrestrial planets.

TI Charge-transfer states in conjugated polymer/fullerene blends: Below-gap
   weakly bound excitons for polymer photovoltaics
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We report on the observation of a charge-transfer state forming at the molecular interface between a conjugated polymer and a fullerene based electron acceptor. Electron hole recombination in this state results in a luminescent transition at 840 nm, energetically separated from the polymer emission. This transition can be directly photoexcited by tuning the excitation energy below the conjugated polymer bandgap, demonstrating that the charge-transfer state originates from a ground-state interaction. By electric field induced quenching of the photoluminescence, we determine a binding energy of 130 meV for excitons in the charge-transfer state. (C) 2008 American Institute of Physics.

TI Small-scale energy cascade of the solar wind turbulence
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB Magnetic fluctuations in the solar wind are distributed according to Kolmogorov's power law f(-5/3) below the ion cyclotron frequency f(ci). Above this frequency, the observed steeper power law is usually interpreted in two different ways, as a dissipative range of the solar wind turbulence, or another turbulent cascade, the nature of which is still an open question. Using the Cluster magnetic data we show that after the spectral break the intermittency increases toward higher frequencies, indicating the presence of nonlinear interactions inherent to a new inertial range and not to the dissipative range. At the same time the level of compressible fluctuations rises. We show that the energy transfer rate and intermittency are sensitive to the level of compressibility of the magnetic fluctuations within the small-scale inertial range. We conjecture that the time needed to establish this inertial range is shorter than the eddy-turnover time, and is related to dispersive effects. A simple phenomenological model, based on the compressible Hall MHD, predicts the magnetic spectrum similar to k(-7/3+2 alpha), which depends on the degree of plasma compression alpha.

TI Organic thin-film photovoltaic cells based on oligothiophenes with
   reduced bandgap
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB The best polymeric solar cells reported so far are based on a so-called bulk heterojunction of a polythiophene as donor and a soluble fullerene derivative as acceptor. However, these cells still suffer from an unsatisfying photovoltage, typically below 0.7 V. Here, we show that we can achieve higher photovoltages using a new terthiophene end-capped with electron withdrawing dicyanovinyl groups (DCV3T) that increase both the ionization energy and even more strongly the electron affinity of the compound. The new material is tested in cells using a photoactive heterojunction to separate the excitones generated in the oligomer and a p-doped wide-gap transport layer. The solar cells show an open circuit voltage of up to 1.04 V and a broad spectral sensitivity band ranging from 420 nm to 620 nm. Solar cells based on such oligothiophenes are promising candidates for stacked organic solar cells tailored to the sun-spectrum. Moreover, we present first examples of a new concept for organic solar cells: By blending DCV3T with fullerene C-60, an enhanced generation of triplet excitons on the oligomer can be achieved via a back and forth transfer of excitons (ping-pong-efffect).

AB Photocatalysis is efficient in several fields. Firstly, in selective mild oxidation: oxidation of gas and liquid hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, cycloalkanes, aromatics) into aldehydes and ketons. Primary and secondary alcohols are also oxidized into their corresponding aldehydes or ketones. The high selectivity was ascribed to a photoactive neutral, atomic oxygen species. Once platinized (only 0.5 wt.% Pt) titania may catalyze reactions involving hydrogen (deuterium-alkane isotopic exchange and alcohol dehydrogenation). For fine chemicals, high initial selectivities enable titania to address most of the twelve principles of "green chemistry", such as the synthesis of 4-tert-butyl-benzaldehyde, an important intermediate in perfume industry by direct selective oxidation of 4-tert-butyl-toluene with air. A new field recently appeared: thio-photocatalysis. Oxygen was replaced by sulfur, using H2S as a convenient and reactive source. For instance, the conversion of propene in 1-propanthiol was successfully obtained. The reaction was performed using either US or TiO2. The latter was much more active than US. In environmental photocatalysis, titania becomes a total oxidation catalyst once in presence of water because of the photogeneration of OH* radicals by neutralization of OH-surface groups by positive holes. Many toxic inorganic ions are oxidized in their harmless upper oxidized state. The total degradation of organic pollutants (pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, dyes, etc....) is the main field of water photocatalytic decontamination. The UVA solar spectrum can de advantageously used as demonstrated by many campaigns performed in the solar pilot plant at the "Plataforma Solar de Almeria" (Spain). (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

TI Synthesis of type IICdTe-CdSe nanocrystal heterostructured
   multiple-branched rods and their photovoltaic applications
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Novel type II CdTe-CdSe semiconductor nanocrystal heterostructures (SNCHs) with multiple-branched rod morphology were synthesized by epitaxial growth of CdSe from CdTe nanocrystals in solution, and the SNCHs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The SNCHs are composed of a CdTe core and CdSe branches, and most of the heterostructured nanocrystals have about 10 branched rods with thickness of 3-5 nm and length of 10-30 nm. The absorption spectra of the SNCHs covered the whole visible region from 380 to 780 nm with a distinct peak at 560 similar to 580 nm corresponding to the absorption of CdSe nanocrystals. The quenching of the photoluminescence (PL) peak of the CdTe core was observed in the SNCHs, which indicates that photoinduced charge separation existed in the SNCHs. Furthermore, the photovoltaic properties of the SNCHs were studied on the basis of the devices with single component of the SNCHs and with the blend of P3HT and the SNCHs. The device based on the SNCHs single component showed an open-circuit voltage (V-oc) of 0.40 V, a short-circuit current density (J(sc)) of 0.018 mA/cm(2), fill factor (FF) of 38%, and power convention efficiency (eta) of 0.003% under the illumination of AM1.5, 100 mW/cm(2), which is greatly improved in comparison with that of the homostructured semiconductor nanocrystals. For the hybrid P3HT/SNCHs device, the J(sc), V-oc, FF, and eta of the device reached 0.58 mA/cm(2), 0.63V, 43%, and 0.16% respectively.

TI Photoluminescence of anatase and rutile TiO2 particles
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B
AB Nonaqueous reactions between titanium(IV) chloride and alcohols ( benzyl alcohol or n-butanol) were used for the synthesis of anatase TiO2 particles, while rutile TiO2 particles were synthesized in aqueous media by acidic hydrolysis of titanium( IV) chloride. The X-ray diffraction measurements proved the exclusive presence of either the anatase or the rutile phase in prepared samples. The photoluminescence of both kinds of particles (anatase and rutile) with several well-resolved peaks extending in the visible spectral region was observed, and the quantum yield at room temperature was found to be 0.25%. Photon energy up-conversion from colloidal anatase and rutile TiO2 particles was observed at low excitation intensities. The energy of up-converted photoluminescence spans the range of emission of normal photoluminescence. The explanation of photon energy up-conversion involves mid-gap energy levels originating from oxygen vacancies.

TI A model for spectral and compositional variability at high energies in
   large, gradual solar particle events
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB Shocks driven by fast coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are generally believed to be the dominant accelerators in large, gradual solar energetic particle (SEP) events. A key challenge for this notion has been the highly variable spectral and compositional characteristics of these events above a few tens of MeV per nucleon. We have recently proposed that this variability results from the interplay of two factors: evolution in the shock-normal angle as the shock moves outward from the Sun; and a compound seed population, typically comprising at least suprathermals from the corona (or solar wind) and suprathermals from flares. We present here a simple analytical implementation of these ideas. Our calculations semiquantitatively reproduce key features of the observed variability, including spectral morphologies and energy dependence in Fe/O, He-3/He-4, and mean ionic charges, in ways that are consistent with correlations in the data. The model makes a prediction for the average high-energy Fe/O enhancement that is borne out by 30 years of observations; the model also provides a quantitative explanation for the Breneman & Stone fractionation effect, a fundamental but previously unexplained aspect of SEP phenomenology. Our calculations must be bolstered by future efforts incorporating realistic CME-shock simulations and a rigorous treatment of particle transport. Suprathermal densities in the corona, as well as details of the injection process at shocks of arbitrary obliquity, require further investigation. Nevertheless, these first results suggest a comprehensive framework for understanding the complexity of high-energy variability in terms of shock physics for most, if not all, large SEP events.

TI Highly sensitive thin-film organic phototransistors: Effect of
   wavelength of light source on device performance
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Organic phototransistors (OPTs) were fabricated from pentacene and copper phthalocyanine (CuPC) based on the geometry of organic field-effect transistors (OFETs); and the effect of the wavelength of the incident light source on their performance was examined. High performance OFETs with pentacene and CuPC were fabricated and the characteristics of the OPTs were examined under UV and visible-light irradiations with top illumination. The CuPC and pentacene OPTs show a high responsivities of 0.5-2 and 10-50 A/W and maximum I-Ph/I-Dark of 3000 and 1.3x10(5), respectively, under 365 nm UV light. However, under visible light, at a wavelength of 650 nm, the pentacene OPTs had 100 times less responsivity, 0.15-0.45 A/W, and a I-Ph/I-Dark of 1000, even though an absorption coefficient three times larger was observed at this wavelength than at 365 nm. A strong correlation was found between the performance of the OPTs and the incident photon to current conversion efficiency spectra of an organic semiconductor. The strong dependence on the wavelength of incident light of the performance of the prepared OPTs can be explained by an internal filter effect in which light with a large absorption coefficient is filtered at the top surface and through the bulk of the film when light is directed onto the opposite side of the OFET gate electrode. Thus, light cannot efficiently contribute to the generation of charge carriers in the channel regions that were formed in the first two molecular layers adjacent to the dielectric interface. Consequently, the most efficient OPTs were produced when the following conditions of incident light were satisfied: The photon energies (or frequencies) should be (i) larger than the band gap and (ii) have a relatively small absorption coefficient, since the light can penetrate down to the channel layer more efficiently when it is near the dielectric interface without any loss in absorption through the film.

TI Experimental analysis of the quasi-Fermi level split in quantum dot
   intermediate-band solar cells
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The intermediate-band solar cell (IBSC) has been proposed as a device whose conversion efficiency can exceed the 40.7% limiting value of single-gap cells. It utilizes the so-called intermediate-band material, characterized by the existence of a band that splits an otherwise conventional semiconductor bandgap into two sub-bandgaps. Two important criteria for its operation are that the carrier populations in the conduction, valence, and intermediate-bands are each described by their own quasi-Fermi levels, and that photocurrent is produced when the cell is illuminated with below-bandgap-energy photons. IBSC prototypes have been manufactured from InAs quantum dot structures and analyzed by electroluminescence and quantum efficiency measurements. We present evidence to show that the two main operating principles required of the IBSC are fulfilled. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics.

Density cavities generated along separatrices bounding growing magnetic islands support parallel electric fields that act as plasma accelerators.

   pump greenhouse heating system
SO ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB Ground-source heat pumps (GSHPs), also known as geothermal heat pumps (GHPs), are recognized to be outstanding heating, cooling and water heating systems, and have been used since 1998 in the Turkish market. Greenhouses also have important economical potential in Turkey's agricultural sector. In addition to solar energy gain, greenhouses should be heated during nights and cold days. In order to establish optimum growth conditions in greenhouses, renewable energy sources should be utilized as much as possible. It is expected that effective use of heat pumps with a suitable technology in the modem greenhouses will play a leading role in Turkey in the foreseeable future.
   The main objective of the present study is to investigate to the performance characteristics of a solar assisted ground-source heat pump greenhouse heating system (SAGSHPGHS) with a 50 m vertical 1 x 1/4 in. nominal diameter U-bend ground heat exchanger using exergy analysis method. This system was designed and constructed in Solar Energy Institute of Ege University, Izmir, Turkey. The exergy transports between the components and the destructions in each of the components of the SAGSHPGHS are determined for the average measured parameters obtained from the experimental results. Exergetic efficiencies of the system components are determined in an attempt to assess their individual performances and the potential for improvements is also presented. The heating coefficient of performances of the ground-source heat pump unit and the overall system are obtained to be 2.64 and 2.38, respectively, while the exergetic efficiency of the overall system is found to be 67.7%.

TI Grain properties of comet C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp)
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB We present the analysis of 7.6-13.2 mum infrared (IR) spectrophotometry (R similar or equal to 250) of comet C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp), in conjunction with concurrent observations that extend the wavelength coverage of the spectral energy distribution from near- to far-infrared wavelengths. The observations include temporal epochs preperihelion (1996 October and 1997 February UT), near perihelion (1997 April UT), and postperihelion (1997 June UT). Through the modeling of the thermal emission from small, amorphous carbon grains and crystalline and amorphous silicate grains in Hale-Bopp's coma, we find that as the comet approached perihelion, the grain size distribution (the Hanner modified power law) steepened (from N = 3.4 preperihelion to N = 3.7 near and postperihelion), along with an increase in the fractal porosity of larger (greater than 1 mum) grains. The peak of the grain size distribution remained constant ( a(p) = 0.2 mum) at each epoch. We attribute the emergence of the 9.3 mum peak near perihelion to crystalline orthopyroxene grains released during epochs of high jet activity. Crystalline silicates (olivine and orthopyroxene) make up about 30% (by mass) of the sub-micronsized (less than or equal to1 mum) dust grains in Hale-Bopp's coma during each epoch.

TI Composition of anomalous cosmic rays and other heliospheric ions
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB Interstellar pickup ions accelerated by the termination shock of the solar wind dominate the anomalous cosmic-ray (ACR) intensities observed by the Voyager spacecraft in the outer heliosphere. Using a two-dimensional acceleration and propagation model, we derive the relative abundances of these interstellar ACRs and determine the mass dependence of the injection/acceleration efficiency for the diffusive acceleration of H(+), He(+), N(+), O(+), and Ne(+). The energy spectra of C, Na, Mg, Si, S, and Ar also exhibit ACR increases at low energies. To interpret these observations, we have developed a new set of ionization rates for 11 neutral atoms, H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Na, Mg, Si, S, and Ar at 1 AU, and a new set of filtration factors relating neutral densities in the local interstellar medium to those at the location of the solar wind termination shock. Using the injection/acceleration efficiencies and the Ar filtration factor, we estimate the density of neutral Ar to be (3.5 +/- 1.6) x 10(-7) cm(-3) in the local interstellar medium. ACR C may have a significant contribution from interstellar neutral C, but the observed intensities of ACR Na, Mg, Si, and S significantly exceed that expected from interstellar neutrals, providing evidence of another source of pickup ions. One possibility discussed is the recently discovered "inner source" of singly charged ions that is thought to be solar wind atoms desorbed from interplanetary dust grains.

AB The dust produced in the Kuiper belt (KB) spreads throughout the solar system, forming a dust disk. We numerically model the orbital evolution of KB dust and estimate its equilibrium spatial distribution and its brightness and spectral energy distribution (SED), assuming graybody absorption and emission by the dust grains. We show that the planets modify the KB disk SED, so potentially we can infer the presence of planets in spatially unresolved debris disks by studying the shape of their SEDs. We point out that there are inherent uncertainties in the prediction of structure in the dust disk, owing to the chaotic dynamics of dust orbital evolution imposed by resonant gravitational perturbations of the planets.

AB dA series of porphyrin derivatives containing carboxylic-, sulfo- and hydro- groups, 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP), 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-sulfophenyl)porphyrin (TSPP) and 5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl-porphyrin (TPP), were examined as sensitizers for porous nanocrystalline TiO2. The difference in the adsorption behavior on the TiO2 electrode surface was discussed. The interaction between the porphyrins and the TiO2 surface was determined and compared using UV-Vis spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The luminescence spectra of the porphyrins in DMF solution and adsorbed onto TiO2 electrodes were measured. The ionization potentials of the porphyrins in the solid state and adsorbed onto TiO2 electrodes were determined by a new approach using an apparatus for measuring the emission yield under atmospheric conditions. The importance of the binding states between the dye and TiO2 surface was discussed by comparison of the energy conversion efficiency in a dye-sensitized solar cell. The results indicate that the binding state and the amount of adsorbed dye are important factors affecting the properties of the dye-sensitized solar cell. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB A three-dimensional coupled model of the thermosphere, ionosphere, plasmasphere and electrodynamics has been used to investigate the dynamic and electrodynamic response at low latitudes during a geomagnetic storm. A storm was simulated at equinox and high solar activity, and was characterized by a 12-h enhancement of the high-latitude magnetospheric electric field and auroral precipitation. The deposition of energy at high-latitudes heats the thermosphere and drives equatorward wind surges, and changes the global circulation. The first wave arrives at the equator, 3.5 h after storm onset. The change in the global circulation drives downwelling at low latitudes, which decreases molecular species, and causes a slight positive ionospheric phase. By far the dominant driver of the low latitudes is due to the changes in electrodynamics. The dynamo effect of the altered wind circulation opposes the normal diurnal variation, with downward ion drift during the day and upward drift at night. On the dayside, the equatorial ionization anomaly becomes weaker, the ionospheric F-region peak height is lowered, and the eastward zonal winds are reduced. At night the anomaly is strengthened, the ionosphere is raised, and zonal winds accelerate. The global electrodynamic changes are consistent with earlier results, but the speed of the response was unexpected. The model results showed an equatorial response within 2 h of the storm onset, well before the first gravity waves arrived at the equator. The dynamo action of the mid-latitude wind surges drive an F-region dynamo that can cause charge buildup at the terminators, producing electric fields that immediately leak to the equator. The meridional winds act as the driver of the low-latitude storm response by changing the dynamo action of the winds. In contrast, the zonal winds respond to the redistribution of charge brought about by the electrodynamic changes, rather than acting as a driver of the change. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Spectra of cometary X rays induced by solar wind ions
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
AB The X-ray and extreme ultraviolet spectra produced by solar wind ions undergoing change transfer collisions with the atoms and molecules present in the atmospheres of comets are calculated. The calculations take account of the cascading transitions that follow electron capture into highly excited states. It is shown that sequential collisions cause the X-ray spectrum from the cometary center to be softer than that of the peripheral regions. Some of the brightest lines arise from forbidden transitions of helium-like oxygen and carbon ions. The X-ray luminosities and averaged spectra reflect the composition of the solar wind. The calculated luminosities and spectra corresponding to a typical distribution of impinging solar wind ions are consistent with observations of comets Hyakutake and Hale-Bopp. The spectral resolution required to establish charge transfer as the source of cometary X rays is discussed; an energy resolution of 10 eV should be adequate.

The resulting HyCOM-TiO2, nanocrystalites were found to be covered by n-butoxide, yielding mesoporous, transparent anatase films with a narrow pore size distribution and good electron transport characteristic when sintered at 350-550 degrees C on optically transparent conducting glass.

AB A brief description of the Sheffield University plasmasphere ionosphere model (SUPIM) is presented. In the model, time-dependent equations of continuity, momentum, and energy balance are solved along eccentric-dipole magnetic field lines for the densities, field-aligned fluxes and temperatures of the O+, H+, He+, N-2(+), O-2(+) and NO+ ions, and the electrons.
   A review of some of the important results from recent studies of the model is presented. The studies show that during daytime, the equatorial plasma fountain can rise to altitudes of around 800 km at the magnetic equator and can cover magnetic latitudes of about +/-30 degrees. At regions outside the fountain, plasma flows towards the magnetic equator from both hemispheres and leads to the formation of an additional layer, the F3 layer, at latitudes close to the magnetic equator (+/-10 degrees). The peak electron density of the F3 layer can exceed that of the F2 layer for a short period of time near noon when the E x B drift is large. Associated with the enhanced electron densities of the F3 layer are reduced electron temperatures. The modelled electron temperatures and densities are in accord with observations made by the Hinotori satellite at 600 km altitude. Closer agreement in the modelled and observed values is achieved if the phase and magnitude of the meridional wind, as given by the HWM90 thermospheric wind model, are modified in accordance with the observations made by the Japanese MU radar and the AE-E satellite. There is better agreement in the modelled and observed values when the equatorial vertical E x B drift velocity model used by SUPIM has an altitude variation in accord with the observations made by the AE-E satellite and at Arecibo.

TI A fast solar wind model with anisotropic proton temperature
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
AB We explore the energy requirements for the fast solar wind when the anisotropy in the proton temperature is taken into account. Using a one-dimensional, two-fluid model with anisotropic proton temperature, we present high-speed solar wind solutions which meet most of the empirical constraints currently available from in situ measurements in interplanetary space and very recent; remote sensing observations of the inner corona. Included in the model is the momentum exerted on the flow by Alfven waves, as well as heating due to their damping. However, to produce solutions consistent with these empirical constraints, additional heat input to both electrons and protons, as well as momentum addition to the protons, are found to be needed. These are described by ad hoc functions with adjustable parameters. While classical thermal conduction is adopted for both electrons and protons in the inner corona in the model computations, the corresponding heat fluxes in the outer corona are limited to, values comparable to current observations, The fast solar wind solutions thus obtained differ from each other mainly in their thermal properties within 0.3 AU from the Sun, a region that is still poorly probed by in situ and remote sensing measurements. To satisfy observational constraints, we find that the inclusion of a proton temperature anisotropy in the modeling of the solar wind requires that either the protons be highly anisotropic in the inner corona or that there exist a mechanism, in addition td adiabatic expansion, to cool them in the direction parallel to the magnetic field. Given these observational constraints and in the absence of knowledge of an efficient cooling mechanism, sur model computations imply that the maximum temperature of the protons in the parallel direction has to be limited to 10(6) K in the corona. Furthermore, because of the strong coupling between electrons and protons, and between the parallel and perpendicular motions, at the coronal base, the electron temperature as well as the perpendicular proton temperature cannot be much higher than 10(6) K there. Although thermal anisotropy of the protons is found to have little influence on the dynamics of the fast solar wind, its inclusion imposes new requirements on the unknown coronal heating mechanisms.

TI The sustainable process index - A new dimension in ecological evaluation
SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB The Sustainable Process Index (SPI) is a measure developed to evaluate the viability of processes under sustainable economic conditions. Its advantages are its universal applicability, its scientific basis, the possibility of adoption in process analyses and syntheses, the high sensitivity for sustainable qualities, and the capability of aggregation to one measure. It has proved to be useful in industrial strategic planning. The concept of the SPI is based on the assumption that in a truly sustainable society the basis of economy is the sustainable flow of solar exergy. The conversion of the solar exergy to services needs area. Thus, area becomes the limiting factor of a sustainable economy. The SPI evaluates the areas needed to provide the raw materials and energy demands and to accommodate by-product flows from a process in a sustainable way. It relates these areas to the area available to a citizen in a given geographical (from regional to global) context. The data necessary to calculate the SPI are usually known at an early stage in process development. The result of the computation is the ratio between the area needed to supply a citizen with a given service and the area needed to supply a citizen with all possible services. Thus, it is a measure of the expense of this service in an economy oriented towards sustainability.

TI Thermal physics of asteroids .1. Effects of shape, heat conduction and
   beaming
SO ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
AB With new technology and space observatories, IR-astronomy has the possibility to become a powerful tool for the investigation of the smaller bodies in the solar system. In order to respond to these expectations it is becoming very important to improve the theoretical understanding of the thermal physics of the asteroids. For example, the often used Standard Thermal Model (STM) is too crude for many applications.
   Therefore, a new thermal model for asteroids is described, which takes shape, pole orientation, heat conduction, and beaming into account. The model is applied to fictitious asteroids spanning a range of parameters, as well as to the arbitrarily chosen asteroid 43 Ariadne, in order to investigate general and practical aspects. This exercise demonstrates how heat conduction decreases the mean flux and amplitude of thermal light curves of asteroids. The heat conduction at the surface of a nonspherical asteroid induces imbalances between the absorbed and the emitted energy, which may have consequences for diameter determinations relying on equilibrium. The surface roughness - here described by spherical craters - causes the beaming of the thermal emission towards the Sun. The beaming also increases the amplitude of the thermal light curve, and is in itself enhanced for elongated asteroids.
   The otherwise time consuming heat diffusion problem is solved numerically once for a range of possible configurations, and the results are stored as Fourier series in interpolation tables. The computational speed has been one design criterion, since it is essential for the modeling of both individual asteroids and the thermophysical behaviour of asteroids in general.

TI THE CALIBRATION OF SYNTHETIC COLORS
SO MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
AB In order to find the transformation equations between calculated and observed photometric systems, sensitivity functions for the passbands of the UBV and Washington systems are combined with observations of stellar fluxes to derive stellar colours. Comparison of these colours with photometry of the same stars gives transformation equations, which are then used to convert a grid of synthetic colours, computed from synthetic spectra for Population I stars, from the synthetic colour systems to the observational systems in a completely model-independent way. We then measure synthetic colours from models for 35 stars with well-known atmospheric parameters and apply the previously determined transformations, yielding calibrated synthetic colours. These are compared with the observed colours for these objects. This comparison indicates that the synthetic (B - V) colours are excellent throughout (within 0.02-0.03 mag of the observations). On the other hand, synthetic (U - B) colours, particularly for the cooler stars, tend to be systematically too blue. The ( U - B) errors are typically 0.1 mag for stars with (B - V) < 1, and can reach nearly 0.4 mag for models of cooler stars. In some cases this disagreement is believed to be caused by too high temperatures being adopted for the coolest stars, but deficiencies in the atomic and molecular line data are likely to contribute as well. To investigate the role played by line list variations, synthetic spectra have been computed using different line lists. Detailed graphical comparisons of synthetic and observed spectra for the Sun are presented to show the fit given by the different line lists. With the exception of one list which predicts many unobserved lines, the differences in synthetic colours which result from the use of these other lists are generally small. The effect of a 'sea' of background weak lines is also explored. We suggest that the missing U-band opacity in the models may arise from a continuous rather than line absorption process.

TI ESTIMATION OF SURFACE ALBEDO FROM SPACE - A PARAMETERIZATION FOR GLOBAL
   APPLICATION
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
AB This study proposes a simple parameterization to derive surface broadband albedo from satellite observations, using the results of detailed radiative transfer computations for a variety of atmospheric and surface conditions. The end result is a single equation that directly yields surface albedo from observed albedo at the top of the atmosphere, solar zenith angle, and total precipitable water. It was demonstrated that the parameterization is valid for retrieval of both instantaneous and daily mean surface albedo. Sensitivity tests were conducted for precipitable water, aerosol, CO2, 03, and temperature profile. Preliminary validation using collocated satellite and tower measurements indicates that the absolute accuracy requirement of 5% for climate studies is well satisfied. A global monthly climatology (excluding polar areas) of surface albedo is then developed from 5 years of Earth Radiation Budget Experiment clear-sky satellite data and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts humidity analysis data. Examination of month-to-month differences for specific 2.5-degrees x 2.5-degrees areas indicate that the absolute random error on monthly estimates is less than 1%. Seasonal variation of surface albedo exceeding 1% can thus be detected. Comparisons with other satellite estimates show much closer agreement than with the values used in some general circulation models and numerical weather prediction models especially over snow/ice and deserts.

TI NONTHERMAL ATMOSPHERIC ESCAPE FROM MARS AND TITAN
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
AB Energy flux spectra and particle concentrations of the hot O and N coranae from Mars and Titan, respectively, resulting primarily from dissociative recombination of molecular ions, have been calculated by means of a Monte Carlo method.  The calculated energy flux spectra lead to an escape flux phi-esc approximately-equals 6 x 10(6) cm-2 s-1 for Mars and phi-esc approximately-equals 2 x 10(6) cm-2 s-1 for Titan, corresponding to a mass loss of about 0.14 kg/s for Mars and about 0.3 kg/s for Titan.  (The contribution of electron impact ionization on N2 amounts to only about 25% of Titan's mass loss).  Mass loss via solar and magnetospheric wind is also estimated using newly calculated mass loading limits.  The mass loss via ion pickup from the extended hot atom corona for Mars amounts to about 0.25 kg/s (O+) and for Titan to about 50 g/s (N2+ or H2CN+).  Thus, the total mass loss rate from Mars and Titan is about the same, i.e. 0.4 kg/s.

TI Determination of band gap energy (E-g) of Cu2ZnSnSe4 thin films: On the
   discrepancies of reported band gap values
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We demonstrate experimental data to elucidate the reason for the discrepancies of reported band gap energy (E-g) of Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) thin films, i.e., 1.0 or 1.5 eV. E-g of the coevaporated CZTSe film synthesized at substrate temperature (T-sub) of 370 degrees C, which was apparently phase pure CZTSe confirmed by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy, is found to be around 1 eV regardless of the measurement techniques. However, depth profile of the same sample reveals the formation of ZnSe at CZTSe/Mo interface. On the other hand, E-g of the coevaporated films increases with T-sub due to the ZnSe formation, from which we suggest that the existence of ZnSe, which is hardly distinguishable from CZTSe by XRD, is the possible reason for the overestimation of overall E-g.

TI Relating the open-circuit voltage to interface molecular properties of
   donor:acceptor bulk heterojunction solar cells
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The open-circuit voltage (V(oc)) of polymer:fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells is determined by the interfacial charge-transfer (CT) states between polymer and fullerene. Fourier-transform photocurrent spectroscopy and electroluminescence spectra of several polymer:fullerene blends are used to extract the relevant interfacial molecular parameters. An analytical expression linking these properties to V(oc) is deduced and shown to be valid for photovoltaic devices comprising three commonly used conjugated polymers blended with the fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). V(oc) is proportional to the energy of the CT states E(CT). The energetic loss q Delta V between E(CT) and qV(oc) vanishes when approaching 0 K. It depends linearly on T and logarithmically on illumination intensity. Furthermore q Delta V can be reduced by decreasing the electronic coupling between polymer and fullerene or by reducing the nonradiative recombination rate. For the investigated devices we find a loss q Delta V of similar to 0.6 eV at room temperature and under solar illumination conditions, of which similar to 0.25 eV is due to radiative recombination via the CT state and similar to 0.35 eV is due to nonradiative recombination.

TI Magnetic flux emergence in granular convection: radiative MHD
   simulations and observational signatures
SO ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
AB Aims. We study the emergence of magnetic flux from the near-surface layers of the solar convection zone into the photosphere.
   Methods. To model magnetic flux emergence, we carried out a set of numerical radiative magnetohydrodynamics simulations. Our simulations take into account the effects of compressibility, energy exchange via radiative transfer, and partial ionization in the equation of state. All these physical ingredients are essential for a proper treatment of the problem. Furthermore, the inclusion of radiative transfer allows us to directly compare the simulation results with actual observations of emerging flux.
   Results. We find that the interaction between the magnetic flux tube and the external flow field has an important influence on the emergent morphology of the magnetic field. Depending on the initial properties of the flux tube ( e. g. field strength, twist, entropy etc.), the emergence process can also modify the local granulation pattern. The emergence of magnetic flux tubes with a flux of 10(19) Mx disturbs the granulation and leads to the transient appearance of a dark lane, which is coincident with upflowing material. These results are consistent with observed properties of emerging magnetic flux.

TI Anisotropic turbulent spectra in the terrestrial magnetosheath as seen
   by the cluster spacecraft
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Here we report the first three-dimensional spatial spectrum of the low frequency magnetic turbulence obtained from the four Cluster spacecraft in the terrestrial magnetosheath close to the magnetopause. We show that the turbulence is compressible and dominated by mirror structures, its energy is injected at a large scale k rho similar to 0.3 (l similar to 2000 km) via a mirror instability well predicted by linear theory, and cascades nonlinearly and unexpectedly up to k rho similar to 3.5 (l similar to 150 km), revealing a new power law in the inertial range not predicted by any turbulence theory, and its strong anisotropy is controlled by the static magnetic field and the magnetopause normal.

TI Principal component and multiple regression analysis in modelling of
   ground-level ozone and factors affecting its concentrations
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
AB Data on the concentrations of seven environmental pollutants (CH4. NMHC, CO, CO2, NO, NO2 and SO2) and meteorological variables(wind speed and direction, air temperature, relative humidity and solar radiation) were employed to predict the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere using both multiple linear and principal component regression methods. Separate analyses were carried out for day light and night time periods. For both periods the pollutants were highly correlated, but were all negatively correlated with ozone. Multiple regression analysis was used to fit the ozone data using the pollutant and meteorological variables as predictors. A variable selection method based on high loadings of varimax rotated principal components was used to obtain subsets of the predictor variables to be included in the regression model of the logarithm of the ozone data. It was found that while high temperature and high solar energy tended to increase the day time ozone concentrations, the pollutants NO and SO2 being emitted to the atmosphere were being depleted. Night time ozone concentrations were influenced predominantly by the nitrogen oxides (NO+NO,), with the meteorological variables playing no significant role. However, the model did not predict the night time ozone concentrations as accurately as it did for the day time. This could be due to other factors that were not explicitly considered in this study.

TI The influence of the optoelectronic properties of
   poly(3-alkylthiophenes) on the device parameters in flexible polymer
   solar cells
SO ORGANIC ELECTRONICS
AB in this report regioregular poly(3-alkylthiophenes) (P3ATs) (P3HT: poly(3-hexylthiophene, P3OT: poly(3-octylthiophene, P3DDT: poly(3-dodecylthiophene) were studied regarding their optical and electrochemical properties and used as electron donors in polymer solar cells. The optical band gap energy for the three polymers amounts to 1.92 eV. With longer side chain length their electrochemical band gaps are slightly increased, whereas the absorption coefficient undergoes a systematic decrease. The absorption spectra of the pristine P3ATs exhibit a distinctive blue shift of the pi-pi* interband transition upon mixing with PCBM 1:3 (as prepared films; P3HT: similar to 45 nm, P3OT: similar to 85 nm, P3DDT: similar to 50 nm). Films based on composites of the three polymers with PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) show a distinctive photoluminescence quenching effect. At 77 K two types of light-induced electron spin resonance (LESR) signals were identified, one of polaron (P+) on the polymer chain and one of PCBM- radical anion, which detect the photoinduced charge generation and charge transfer in P3AT/PCBM composites. Photovoltaic devices were prepared on flexible PET-ITO foils on ambient conditions using P3HT/PCBM (1:3 wt.%) with eta(AM1.5) = 1.54%, P3OT/PCBM (1:3 wt.%) with eta(AM1.5) = 1.1% and P3DDT/PCBM (1:3 wt.%) with eta(AM1.5) = 0.59% (A: 0.25 cm(2), P-IN = 100 mW/cm(2)). The serial and parallel resistance increases within the series P3HT:PCBM < P3OT:PCBM < P3DDT:PCBM cells, therefore the short-circuit current decreases and the open-circuit voltage increases in this order.

TI Efficient polymer-nanocrystal quantum-dot photodetectors
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We have realized highly efficient photodetectors based on composites of the semiconducting polymer poly[2-methoxy-5-(2'-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] and PbSe nanocrystal quantum dots. The external quantum efficiency in these devices is greater than 1 for electric fields E similar to 7 X 10(5) V/cm. The observed photocurrent gain could be attributed to the carrier multiplication in PbSe nanocrystal quantum dots via multiple exciton generation, and the efficient charge conduction through the host polymer material. This photocurrent gain is observed only when the PbSe nanocrystal band gap is at least three times smaller than the optical energy gap of the active polymer material.

TI Flux and turbulence measurements at a densely built-up site in
   Marseille: Heat, mass (water and carbon dioxide), and momentum
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
AB Eddy covariance (EC) observations above the densely built-up center of Marseille during the Experience sur site pour contraindre les modeles de pollution atmospherique et de transport d'emissions (ESCOMPTE) summertime measurement campaign extend current understanding of surface atmosphere exchanges in cities. The instrument array presented opportunities to address issues of the representativeness of local-scale fluxes in urban settings. Separate EC systems operated at two levels, and a telescoping tower allowed the pair to be exposed at two different sets of heights. The flux and turbulence observations taken at the four heights, stratified by wind conditions (mistral wind and sea breeze), are used to address the partitioning of the surface energy balance in an area with large roughness elements. The turbulent sensible heat flux dominates in the daytime, although the storage heat flux is a significant term that peaks before solar noon. The turbulent latent heat flux is small but not negligible. Carbon dioxide fluxes show that this central city district is almost always a source, but the vegetation reduces the magnitude of the fluxes in the afternoon. The atmosphere in such a heavily developed area is rarely stable. The turbulence characteristics support the empirical functions proposed by M. Roth.

TI Nanoflare heating of the corona revisited
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB The radiative signatures of the nanoflare model for coronal heating are investigated. If an observed coronal loop is assumed to consist of many small strands that cannot be distinguished spatially by EUV or X-ray observations, we are able to calculate differential emission-measure profiles and filling factors for a range of heating models. In this picture the strands undergo continual heating and cooling, leading to a corona comprising strands with a broad range of temperatures and densities. Thus, observations over a range of temperatures will show a multithermal coronal structure. The cyclical heating-cooling leads inevitably to loops that are underdense and overdense at high and low temperatures, respectively, compared to what would be expected from static equilibrium models, and in addition, we show that differential emission-measure profiles with shallow slopes can be obtained, as reported in recent observations. The differences between filling factors that can be seen by broadband and narrowband instruments are explored. Loops with broadband filling factors near unity can still have small narrowband factors, and the narrowband factor is shown to be a strong function of the local temperature. Nanoflare energy distributions that are constant, flat, or power laws are considered. Power laws lead to wide distributions of temperatures and densities in the corona, and steep power laws lead to larger filling factors.

TI Downflow motions associated with impulsive nonthermal emissions observed
   in the 2002 July 23 solar flare
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB We present a detailed examination of downflow motions above flare loops observed in the 2002 July 23 flare. The extreme-ultraviolet images obtained with the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer show dark downflow motions ( sunward motions) above the postflare loops, not only in the decay phase but also in the impulsive and main phases. We also found that the times when the downflow motions start to be seen correspond to the times when bursts of nonthermal emissions in hard X-rays and microwaves are emitted. This result implies that the downflow motions occurred when strong magnetic energy was released and that they are, or are correlated with, reconnection outflows.

TI Evidence for a suprathermal seed population of heavy ions accelerated by
   interplanetary shocks near 1 AU
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB We have surveyed the 0.1-10 MeV nucleon(-1) elemental abundances at 72 interplanetary (IP) shocks observed by the Ultra-Low-Energy Isotope Spectrometer on board the Advanced Composition Explorer from 1997 October through 2002 September. We find the following: (1) The C/O ratios in IP shocks were substantially depleted (by more than similar to40%) relative to solar wind values. (2) The IP shock abundances were poorly correlated with those measured in the slow and fast solar wind. (3) Energetic ions above similar to0.1 MeV nucleon(-1) from impulsive and gradual solar energetic particle events (SEPs) were present upstream of all the IP shocks in our survey. (4) The similar to1 MeV nucleon similar to1 Fe/O ratio in IP shocks was positively correlated with that measured upstream of the shocks. (5) The IP shock abundances were well correlated with the upstream abundances, with a negative dependence on mass/charge. (6) The mean Fe/O ratio in IP shocks exhibited a positive correlation with the level of solar activity, as measured by the occurrence rates of X-ray flares and sunspots. The above results are inconsistent with shock acceleration of ions originating mainly from the bulk solar wind or a suprathermal tail composed predominantly of solar wind ions. Instead, it appears that for the events surveyed here, the IP shocks accelerated a seed population predominantly comprising ions that were previously accelerated in impulsive and gradual SEPs and that the shock acceleration process accelerated higher rigidity ions less efficiently than lower rigidity ions.

TI Rapid changes of magnetic fields associated with six X-class flares
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB In this paper, we present the results of the study of six X-class flares. We found significant changes in the photospheric magnetic fields associated with all of the events. For the five events in 2001, when coronagraph data were available, all were associated with halo coronal mass ejections. Based on the analyses of the line-of-sight magnetograms, all six events had an increase in the magnetic flux of the leading polarity of order of a few times 10(20) Mx while each event had some degree of decrease in the magnetic flux of the following polarity. The flux changes are considered impulsive because the "changeover" time, which we defined as the time to change from preflare to post are state, ranged from 10 to 100 minutes. The observed changes are permanent. Therefore, the changes are not due to changes in the line pro le caused by are emissions. For the three most recent events, when vector magnetograms were available, two showed an impulsive increase of the transverse field strength and magnetic shear after the flares, as well as new sunspot area in the form of penumbral structure. One of the events in this study was from the previous solar cycle. This event showed a similar increase in all components of the magnetic field, magnetic shear, and sunspot area. We present three possible explanations to explain the observed changes: (1) the emergence of very inclined flux loops, (2) a change in the magnetic field direction, and (3) the expansion of the sunspot, which moved some flux out of Zeeman saturation. However, we have no explanation for the polarity preference; i.e., the flux of leading polarity tends to increase while the flux of following polarity tends to decrease slightly.

TI Fate of the sterile neutrino
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB In light of recent Super-Kamiokande data and global fits that seem to exclude both pure nu(mu) --> nu(s) oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos and pure nu(e) --> nu(s) oscillations of solar neutrinos (where nu(s) is a sterile neutrino), we reconsider four-neutrino models to explain the LSND, atmospheric, and solar neutrino oscillation indications. We argue that the solar data, with the exception of the Cl-37 results, are suggestive of v(e) --> v(s) oscillations that average to a probability of approximately 1/2. In this interpretation, with two pairs of nearly degenerate mass eigenstates separated by order 1 eV, the day-night asymmetry, seasonal dependence, and energy dependence for B-8 neutrinos should be small. Alternatively, we find that four-neutrino models with one mass eigenstate widely separated from the others (and with small sterile mixings to active neutrinos) may now be acceptable in light of recently updated LSND results; the Cl-37 data can be accommodated in this model. For each scenario, we present simple four-neutrino mixing matrices that fit the stated criterion and discuss future tests. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI New boundary integral equation representation for finite energy
   force-free magnetic fields in open space above the Sun
SO SOLAR PHYSICS
AB A boundary integral equation to describe a force-free magnetic field with finite energy content in the open space above the solar surface is found. This is a new representation for a 3-D nonlinear force-free field in terms of the boundary field and its normal gradient at the boundary. Therefore the magnetic field observed on the solar surface can be incorporated into the formulation directly and a standard numerical technique, the boundary element method, can be applied to solve the field. A numerical test case demonstrates the power of the method by recovering the analytical solution to the desired accuracy and its application to practical solar magnetic field problems is straightforward and promising.

TI The long-range supraorganization of the bacterial photosynthetic unit: A
   key role for PufX
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Bacterial photosynthesis relies on the interplay between light harvesting and electron transfer complexes, all of which are located within the intracytoplasmic membrane. These complexes capture and transfer solar energy, which is used to generate a proton gradient. In this study, we identify one of the factors that determines the organization of these complexes. We undertook a comparison of the organization of the light-harvesting complex 1 (LH1)/reaction center (RC) cores in the LH2(-) mutant of Rhodobacter sphaeroides in the presence or absence of the PufX protein. From polarized absorption spectra on oriented membranes, we conclude that PufX induces a specific orientation of the reaction center in the LH1 ring, as well as the formation of a long-range regular array of LH1-RC cores in the photosynthetic membrane. From our data, we have constructed a precise model of how the RC is positioned within the LH1 ring relative to the long (orientation) axis of the photosynthetic membrane.

   by carbon burning. V. Shell convection sustained by helium burning,
   transient neon burning, dredge-out, urca cooling, and other properties
   of an 11 M-circle dot population I model star
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB A stellar model of mass 11 M. and Population I composition is evolved from the hydrogen-burning main sequence through the core carbon-burning phase. In contrast with 9, 10, and 10.5 M. models studied in earlier papers of this series, carbon burning is ignited at the center of the 11 M, model. Like the 10.5 M, model, the 11 M. model experiences a dredge-out episode at the end of the carbon-burning phase. At the beginning of this episode, a semiconvective zone forms at the base of the hydrogen-rich envelope and carries hydrogen inward in mass toward the outer edge of a fully convective zone that is sustained by helium burning at its base. Hydrogen diffuses into the helium-rich convective zone until a hydrogen shell flash occurs. Helium burning dies out and the outer edge of the convective layer, sustained by fluxes due to hydrogen burning, extends outward in mass through hydrogen-rich material, mixing freshly synthesized nuclei outward. Then, hydrogen burning dies out and the outer edge of the convective shell, now sustained primarily by fluxes due to the release of gravothermal energy, moves outward until it reaches the inner edge of the convective envelope. Freshly synthesized material is then convected to the surface. Mixing during the final phase of homogenization in the convective envelope is maintained by fluxes due to the release of gravothermal energy. At the end of the dredge-out phase, the surface nitrogen abundance has decreased and the C/N ratio has changed from less than unity to larger than unity, showing that mixing has extended into regions where helium burning has manufactured substantial quantities of C-12 and destroyed N-14. Prior to the dredge-out phase, neon burning is narrowly averted, and, after the dredge-out phase, neutrino losses due to electron capture and decay reactions between A = 25 and A = 23 isotopes in and above convective Urea shells cool the inner portions of the electron-degenerate oxygen-neon (ONe) core. Ultimately, the model becomes a thermally pulsing super-asymptotic giant branch (TPSAGB) star with an ONe core of mass similar to 1.368 M.. Hydrogen and helium burning over a period of similar to 1.4 x 10(4) yr of TPSAGB evolution add a carbon-oxygen layer of mass similar to 0.014 M. to the electron-degenerate core. Then, electron captures on products of carbon burning lead to the collapse of the core into a neutron star and expulsion of the envelope in a weak Type II supernova explosion. The ratio of helium to hydrogen in the ejecta is approximately twice solar.

To check the response of this experiment to low-energy neutrinos, a 517 kCi source of Cr-51 was produced by irradiating 512.7 g of 92.4%-enriched Cr-50 in a high-flux fast neutron reactor. This source, which mainly emits monoenergetic 747-keV neutrinos, was placed at the center of a 13.1 ton target of liquid gallium and the cross section for the production of Ge-71 by the inverse beta decay reaction Ga-71(nu(e),e(-))Ge-71 was measured to be [5.55+/-0.60 (stat)+/-0.32 (syst)] X 10(-45) cm(2) The ratio of this cross section to the theoretical cross section of Bahcall for this reaction is 0.95 +/- 0.12 (expt)(-0.027)(+0.035) (theor) and to the cross section of Haxton is 0.87 +/- 0.11 (expt)+/- 0.09 (theor). This good agreement between prediction and observation implies that the overall experimental efficiency is correctly determined and provides considerable evidence for the reliability of the solar neutrino measurement.

TI Solar cycle variability of hot oxygen atoms at Mars
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
AB The population of hot oxygen atoms in the Martian exosphere is reexamined using newly calculated hot O production rates for both low and high solar cycle conditions. The hot oxygen production rates are assumed to result from the dissociative recombination of O-2(+) ions. These calculations take into account the calculated vibrational distribution of O-2(+) and the new measured branching ratios. Furthermore, these calculations also consider the variation of the dissociative recombination cross section with the relative speed of the participating ions and electrons, the rotational energy of the O-2(+) ions, and the spread of the ion and electron velocities. These production rates were next used in a two-stream model to obtain the energy dependent flux of the hot oxygen atoms as a function of altitude. Finally, the calculated flux at the exobase was input into an exosphere model, based on Liouville's theorem, to calculate the hot oxygen densities as a function of altitude in the exosphere and the resulting escape flux. It was found that hot oxygen densities vary significantly over the solar cycle; the calculated densities vary from about 2x10(3) to 6x10(3) cm(-3) at an altitude of 1000 km. The escape flux also varies from about 3x10(6) to 9x10(6) cm(-2) s(-1).

TI Evidence against stellar chromospheric origin of Galactic cosmic rays
SO NATURE
AB Interstellar space is filled with a gas of relativistic ions and electrons-the Galactic cosmic rays. These energetic particles tie interstellar gas to ambient magnetic fields by ionizing the component molecules and atoms, and so play a role in stabilizing molecular clouds against collapse(1) and regulating the collapse of protostellar clouds(2). The observed energy spectrum of cosmic rays up to greater than or similar to 10(15) eV is consistent with their acceleration by supernova shock waves(3), but the original source of cosmic-ray nuclei remains unclear. There has been a widely held belief that the source consists of a solar-like ionized medium(4), probably the chromospheres of late-type Sun-like stars(5). This model predicts an overabundance of easily ionized elements, Here we show that lead, which is easily ionized, is underabundant in the Galactic cosmic rays in contradiction with this model. Rather, our measurements are consistent with two other possible models: one in which the nuclei originate in interstellar gas, and in entire grains accelerated to about one per cent of the speed of light by supernova shock : waves(6,7); and another in which the cosmic rays contain an admixture of an exotic, freshly synthesized component(8), probably originating in neutrino-driven winds from newly born neutron stars(9).

TI Comparison of nu(mu)<->nu(tau) and nu(mu)<->nu(s) oscillations as
   solutions of the atmospheric neutrino problem
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The simplest explanation for the atmospheric neutrino anomaly is the transition of muon neutrinos and antineutrinos into states of different flavor. Data from the reactor experiment CHOOZ, and the measurement of the energy and angle distribution of electronlike events at Super-Kamiokande put strong constraints on nu(mu)-nu(e) mixing, but the transitions nu(mu) --> nu(tau) and nu(mu) --> nu(s) are viable possibilities. If the muon neutrinos are mixed with a singlet sterile state, the energy and zenith angle dependence of the oscillation probability is modified by matter effects that are important for E-nu/\Delta m(2)\greater than or similar to 10(3) GeV/eV(2). We confront the theoretical predictions with existing data on contained events and neutrino-induced upward-going muons. [S0556-2821(98)00319-1]

TI Quantifying uncertainties in primordial nucleosynthesis without Monte

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We present a simple method for determining the (correlated) uncertainties of the light element abundances expected from big bang nucleosynthesis, which avoids the need for lengthy Monte Carlo simulations. Our approach helps to clarify the role of the different nuclear reactions contributing to a particular elemental abundance and makes it easy to implement energy-independent changes in the measured reaction rates, As an application, we demonstrate how this method simplifies the statistical estimation of the nucleon-to-photon ratio through comparison of the standard BBN predictions with the observationally inferred abundances.

TI Education and solar conversion: Demonstrating electron transfer
SO SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS
CT International Symposium on H2 Fuel Cell Photovoltaic Systems
CY AUG 31-SEP 05, 1998
CL CANCUN, MEXICO
AB A simplified solar cell fabrication procedure is presented that uses natural anthocyanin or chlorophyll dyes extracted from plants. This procedure illustrates how interdisciplinary science can be taught at lower division university and upper division high school levels for an understanding of renewable energy as well as basic science concepts. Electron transfer occurs on the Earth in the mitochondrial membranes found in living cells, and in the thylakoid membranes found in the photosynthetic cells of green plants. Since we depend on the results of this electron and energy transfer, e.g. in our use of petroleum and agricultural products, it is desirable to understand and communicate how the electron transfer works. The simplified solar cell fabrication procedure, based on nanocrystalline dye-sensitized solar cells, has therefore been developed so that it can be inexpensively reproduced and utilized in the teaching of basic principles in biology, chemistry, physics, and environmental science. A water-based solution of commercial nanocrystalline titanium dioxide (TiO2) powder is used to deposit a highly porous semiconductor electron acceptor. This acceptor couples the light-driven processes occurring at an organic dye to the macroscopic world and an external electrical circuit. Materials science and semiconductor physics are emphasized during the deposition of the sintered TiO2 nanocrystalline ceramic film. Chelation, complexation and molecular self-assembly are demonstrated during the attachment of the dye molecule to the surface of the TiO2 semiconductor particles. Environmental chemistry and energy conversion can be linked to these concepts via the regenerative oxidation and reduction cycle found in the cell. The resulting device, made in under 3 h, can be used as a light detector or power generator that produces 0.4-0.5 V at open circuit, and 1-2 mA per square cm under solar illumination.

TI Inference of marine stratus cloud optical depths from satellite
   measurements: Does 1D theory apply?
SO JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
AB The validity of plane-parallel (1D) radiative transfer theory for cloudy atmospheres is examined by directly comparing calculated and observed visible reflectances for one month of Global Area Coverage Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer satellite observations of marine stratus cloud layers off the coasts of California, Peru, and Angola. Marine stratus are an excellent testbed, as they arguably are the closest to plane-parallel found in nature. Optical depths in a 1D radiative transfer model are adjusted so that 1D model reflectances match those observed at nadir on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The 1D cloud optical depth distributions are then used in the plane-parallel model to generate reflectance distributions for different sun-earth-satellite viewing geometries. These reflectance distributions are directly compared with the observations. Separate analyses are performed for overcast and broken cloud layers as identified by the spatial coherence method.
   When 1D reflectances are directly compared with observations at different view angles, relative differences are generally small (less than or similar to 10%) in the backscattering direction for solar zenith angles less than or similar to 60 degrees and show no systematic view angle dependence. In contrast, 1D reflectances increase much more rapidly with view angle than the observed reflectances in the forward-scattering direction. Relative differences in the forward-scattering direction are approximate to 2-3 times larger than in the backscattering direction. At solar zenith angles less than or similar to 60 degrees, the 1D model underestimates observed reflectances at nadir by 20%-30% and overestimates reflectances at the most oblique view angles in the forward scattering direction by 15%-20%. Consequently, when inferred on a pixel-by-pixel basis, nadir-derived cloud optical depths show a systematic increase with solar zenith angle, both for overcast and broken cloud layers, and cloud optical depths decrease with view angle in the forward scattering direction. Interestingly, in the case of broken marine stratocumulus, the common practice of assuming that pixels are overcast when they are not mitigates this bias to some extent, thereby confounding its detection. But even for broken clouds, the bias remains.
   Because of the nonlinear dependence of cloud albedo on cloud optical depth, errors in cloud optical depth lead to large errors in cloud albedo-and therefore energy budget calculations-regardless of whether cloud layers are overcast or broken. These findings suggest that as a minimum requirement, direct application of the plane-parallel model approximation should be restricted to moderate-high sun elevations and to view angles in the backscattering direction. Based on Monte Carlo simulations, the likely reason for the discrepancies between observed radiances and radiances calculated on the basis of 1D theory is because real clouds have inhomogeneous (i.e., bumpy) tops.

TI Temporal evolution of nonthermal spectra from supernova remnants
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB Assuming that supernova shocks accelerate nonthermal particles, we model the temporally evolving nonthermal particle and photon spectra at different stages in the lifetime of a standard shell-type supernova remnant (SNR). A characteristic vF(v) spectrum of an SNR consists of a peak at radio through optical energies from nonthermal electron synchrotron emission and another high-energy gamma-ray peak due primarily to secondary pion production, nonthermal electron bremsstrahlung, and Compton scattering. We find that supernova remnants are capable of producing maximum gamma-ray luminosities greater than or similar to 10(35) ergs s(-1) if the density of the local interstellar medium is greater than or similar to 10 cm(-3). This emission will persist for greater than or similar to 10(5) yr after the supernova explosion because of the long energy loss timescales for electrons with kinetic energy similar to 1 GeV. This long gamma-ray lifetime implies that SNRs with a wide range of ages could be gamma-ray sources and could constitute some of the unidentified EGRET sources.

TI The ionic charge of solar energetic particles with energies of 0.3-70
   MeV per nucleon
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB With the three particle sensors Low Energy Ion Composition Analyzer (LICA), Heavy Ion Large Area Proportional Counter Telescope (HILT), and Mass Spectrometer Telescope (MAST) on board the polar-orbiting Solar, Anomalous, and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer (SAMPEX) satellite, the ionic charge of solar energetic particles (SEP) was measured over a wide energy range from 0.3 to 70 MeV per nucleon. For each sensor, the evaluation was performed separately. The results obtained with LICA (0.3-10 MeV per nucleon) and MAST (15-70 MeV per nucleon) were published earlier by Mason et al. and Leske et al., respectively. In this work we present the results of the HILT sensor (7-50 MeV per nucleon) and discuss the combined results of the three instruments.
   With HILT, the mean ionic charge of SEP was measured for carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, neon, magnesium, silicon, sulfur, argon, calcium, and iron in the energy range 7-50 MeV per nucleon during two consecutive large SEP events in 1992 October-November. The mean ionic charge was inferred from the rigidity-dependent geomagnetic flux cutoff. The coronal temperatures deduced from the mean ionic charges are well in accordance with the value of similar to 2 x 10(6) K except for neon and magnesium, as previously reported.
   The data measured with the three sensors, LICA, HILT, and MAST, agree well and are in accordance with data previously measured at energies below 3 MeV per nucleon (Luhn et al.), except for iron, where we observed a significant energy dependence of the mean charge over the energy range 0.3-70 MeV per nucleon.

TI Merocyanine aggregation in mesoporous networks
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Nanocrystalline films of TiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2 were used as hosts for the merocyanine 3-acetyl-5-(2-(3-ethyl-2-benzothiazolidinylidene)ethylidene)rhodanine (Mc2) to scrutinize templating effects in the accommodation of the dye within their porous network. Composed of interconnected mesoscopic oxide particles and pores, these films are transparent, allowing for a straightforward application of transmission spectroscopy to unravel the optical features of the incorporated dye species. Apart from H-aggregation, the formation of two different types of two-dimensional assemblies was witnessed yielding red-shifted absorption bands which were identified as J-aggregates, one showing Davidov splitting, the other having a single exciton band. The herringbone packing of the dye molecules in the layered structure of Mc2 sodium salt octahydrate single crystals was taken to model the double-banded J-aggregate structure. On mesoscopic hydroxylated TiO2 anatase films, the structure of the Mc2 assemblies is controlled by the texture of the highly porous substrates as well as their surface charge. Furthermore, it responds in a striking fashion to the presence of solvent in the ambient to which the films are exposed. Double-banded (herringbone structure) and single-banded (parallel alignment of the dye) absorption spectra can thus be obtained. The role of solvent is to stabilize one particular aggregate geometry through intercalation into the Mc2 aggregate. Electron injection into TiO2 from both types of J-aggregates is observed. Laser flash photolysis experiments show that energy transfer from the monomer to the J-aggregate is operative prior to charge injection. On hydroxylated Al2O3 and ZrO2 surfaces Mc2 undergoes physisorption and formation of H-aggregates exhibiting a blue-shifted absorption with regard to the monomer spectrum. Contrary to the results obtained for TiO2 substrates, aggregation is hardly influenced by solvent in the ambient. In particular no J-aggregates can be formed on bare Al2O3 and ZrO2 substrates. However, when the porous films are impregnated with concentrated hydroxide solutions, H- as well as J-aggregates are formed in humid air. At high humidity, due to the hygroscopic salt coating, the pores are completely filled with water, leading to the precipitation of the dye molecules forming H-aggregates. At lower humidity an air-water interface builds up within the pores an da double-banded J-aggregate spectrum appears. The spectrum is almost identical to the one measured on Mc2 sodium slat octahydrate single crystals with a layered organic-inorganic structure. Resonance fluorescence originating from the energetically lower exciton band and internal conversion from the higher to the lower exciton band take place.

TI Seasonal variation in radiative and turbulent exchange at a deciduous
   forest in central Massachusetts
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY
AB Temperate deciduous forests exhibit dramatic seasonal changes in surface exchange properties following on the seasonal changes in leaf area index. Nearly continuous measurements of turbulent and radiative fluxes above and below the canopy of a red oak forest in central Massachusetts have been ongoing since the summer of 1991. Several seasonal trends are obvious. Global solar albedo and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) albedo both are good indicators of the spring leaf emergence and autumnal defoliation of the canopy. The solar albedo decreases throughout the summer, a change attributed to decreasing near-infrared reflectance since the PAR reflectance remains the same. Biweekly satellite composite images in visible and near-infrared wavelengths confirm these trends. The thermal emissions from the canopy relative to the net radiation follow a separate trend with a maximum in the midsummer and minima in spring and fall. The thermal response number computed from the change in radiation temperature relative to the net radiation is directly related to the Bowen ratio or energy partition. The subcanopy space follows a different pattern dictated by the presence of the canopy; there the midday sensible heat flux is a maximum in spring and fall when the canopy is leafless, while subcanopy CO2 flux is maximum in midsummer. Subcanopy evapotranspiration did not have a distinct seasonal peak in spring, summer, or fall. The temperature dependence of the respiration rate estimated from the eddy correlation subcanopy CO2 flux is comparable to that found using nocturnal flux measurements.
   The surface energy balance follows a seasonal pattern in which the ratio of turbulent sensible heat flux to the net radiation (Q(H)/Q(*)) is a maximum in the spring and fail (0.5-0.6), while the latent heat flux (Q(E)) peaks in midsummer (Q(E)/Q(*) = 0.5). This pattern gives rise to a parabolic growing season shape to the Bowen ratio with a minimum in early August. Growing season changes in the canopy resistance (R(C)), related to the trends in me Bowen ratio, are more likely to be predicted using the thermal channels of remote sensing instruments than the shorter-wavelength bands.

TI A GIGANTIC CORONAL JET EJECTED FROM A COMPACT ACTIVE-REGION IN A CORONAL
   HOLE
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB A gigantic coronal jet greater than 3 x 10(5) km long (nearly half the solar radius) has been found with the soft X-ray telescope (SXT) on board the solar X-ray satellite, Yohkoh. The jet was ejected on 1992 January 11 from an ''anemone-type'' active region (AR) appearing in a coronal hole and is one of the largest coronal X-ray jets observed so far by SXT. This gigantic jet is the best observed example of many other smaller X-ray jets, because the spatial structures of both the jet and the AR located at its base are more easily resolved. The range of apparent translational velocities of the bulk of the jet was between 90 and 240 km s-1, with the corresponding kinetic energy estimated to be of order of 10(28) ergs. A detailed analysis reveals that the jet was associated with a loop brightening (a small flare) that occurred in the active region. Several features of this observation suggest and are consistent with a magnetic reconnection mechanism for the production of such a ''jet-loop-brightening'' event.

TI PRESSURE CHANGES IN THE PLASMA SHEET DURING SUBSTORM INJECTIONS
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
AB Using data from the CHEM instrument on AMPTE CCE, data from the three-dimensional plasma instrument and the SULEICA instrument on AMPTE IRM, and magnetometer data from both spacecraft, we have determined the particle pressure and total pressure as a function of radial distance in the plasma sheet for periods before and after the onset of substorm-associated ion enhancements over the radial range 7-19 R(E).  We have chosen events occurring during times of increasing magnetospheric activity, as determined by an increasing AE index, in which a sudden increase, or "injection," of energetic particle flux is observed.  During these events the particle energy of maximum contribution to the pressure increases from about 12 to about 27 keV.  In addition, the particle pressure increases, and the magnetic pressure decreases, with the total pressure only changing slightly.  For radial distances of less than 10 R(E) the total pressure tends to increase with the injection, while outside 10 R(E) it tends to decrease or remain the same.  Because the fraction of the pressure due to particles has increased and higher energies are contributing to the pressure, a radial gradient is evident in the postinjection, but not preinjection, flux measurements.  These observations show that the simultaneous appearance of energetic particles and changes in the magnetic field results naturally from pressure balance and does not necessarily indicate that the local changing field is accelerating the particles.  The changes in the total pressure outside 10 R(E) are consistent with previous measurements of pressure changes at substorm onset and can be understood in terms of the unloading of energy in the magnetotail and the resulting change in the magnetic field configuration.  The increase in pressure at R less-than-or-equal-to 10 R(E) may also be due to the changing magnetic field configuration if in the region close to the Earth where the field becomes more dipolar, the angle at which the solar wind interacts with the magnetopause increases, while farther down the tail it decreases.  Finally, the radial pressure gradient observed in the 7-12 R(E) region agrees very well with that necessary to maintain stress balance for an isotropic plasma.

TI THE METAL ABUNDANCE AND SPECIFIC ENERGY OF INTRACLUSTER GAS
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB The hot gas in the cores of rich galaxy clusters is metal-rich with nearly solar abundances of metals.  It is not clear whether the metals were shed from galaxies via protogalactic winds or via ram-pressure stripping.  It has been suggested that if metals were injected via centrally concentrated stripping, the overall abundances could be much less than those observed in cluster cores, diminishing the degree of stellar processing required.  The observed energetics of intracluster gas can be used to deduce the metal injection mechanism, which in turn may allow the global metal abundance uncertainty to be resolved in the absence of spatially resolved X-ray spectra.  Existing X-ray spectral and surface brightness data for galaxy clusters indicate that the gas in cool clusters has substantially greater specific energy than could have been gained through cluster collapse.  Supernovae-driven protogalactic winds can provide this extra energy (which would be much less significant in hot clusters), while ram-pressure stripping cannot. Such protogalactic winds will distribute metals fairly homogeneously. Much processing of gas through stars is then required, with protogalaxies losing perhaps one-half of their initial luminous mass in metal-rich winds.  Furthermore, the oxygen-to-iron ratio observed in two clusters indicates that the bulk of the iron in cluster gas was produced by Type II supernovae, not Type I supernovae as is usually supposed.

TI Techno-economic analysis of autotrophic microalgae for fuel production
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB It is well-established that microalgal-derived biofuels have the potential to make a significant contribution to the US fuel market, due to several unique characteristics inherent to algae. Namely, autotrophic microalgae are capable of achieving very high efficiencies in converting solar energy into biomass and oil relative to terrestrial oilseed crops, while at the same time exhibiting great flexibility in the quality of land and water required for algal cultivation. These characteristics allow for the possibility to produce appreciable amounts of algal biofuels relative to today's petroleum fuel market, while greatly mitigating "food-versus-fuel" concerns. However, there is a wide lack of public agreement on the near-term economic viability of algal biofuels, due to uncertainties and speculation on process scale-up associated with the nascent stage of the algal biofuel industry.
   The present study aims to establish baseline economics for two microalgae pathways, by performing a comprehensive analysis using a set of assumptions for what can plausibly be achieved within a five-year timeframe. Specific pathways include autotrophic production via both open pond and closed tubular photobioreactor (PBR) systems. The production scales were set at 10 million gallons per year of raw algal oil, subsequently upgraded to a "green diesel" blend stock via hydrotreating. Rigorous mass balances were performed using Aspen Plus simulation software, and associated costs were evaluated on a unit-level basis. Upon completing the base case scenarios, the cost of lipid production to achieve a 10% return was determined to be $8.52/gal for open ponds and $18.10/gal for PBRs. Hydrotreating to produce a diesel blend stock added onto this marginally, bringing the totals to $9.84/gal and $20.53/gal of diesel, for the respective cases. These costs have potential for significant improvement in the future if better microalgal strains can be identified that would be capable of sustaining high growth rates at high lipid content. Given that it is difficult to maximize both of these parameters simultaneously, it was determined that the near-term research should focus on maximizing lipid content as it offers more substantial cost reduction potential relative to an improved algae growth rate. Additional economic sensitivity studies were established to identify other important cost drivers, and a resource assessment comparison was made to evaluate parameters such as water and CO(2) requirements.

TI The Intermediate Band Solar Cell: Progress Toward the Realization of an
   Attractive Concept
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB The intermediate band (IB) solar cell has been proposed to increase the current of solar cells while at the same time preserving the output voltage in order to produce an efficiency that ideally is above the limit established by Shockley and Queisser in 1961. The concept is described and the present realizations and acquired understanding are explained. Quantum dots are used to make the cells but the efficiencies that have been achieved so far are not yet satisfactory. Possible ways to overcome the issues involved are depicted. Alternatively, and against early predictions, IB alloys have been prepared and cells that undoubtedly display the 18 behavior have been fabricated, although their efficiency is still low. Full development of this concept is not trivial but it is expected that once the development of IB solar cells is fully mastered, IB solar cells should be able to operate in tandem in concentrators with very high efficiencies or as thin cells at low cost with efficiencies above the present ones.

TI Relative roles of biogenic emissions and Saharan dust as ice nuclei in
   the Amazon basin
SO NATURE GEOSCIENCE
AB Some aerosol particles, known as ice nuclei, can initiate ice formation in clouds, thereby influencing precipitation, cloud dynamics and the amount of incoming and outgoing solar radiation. In the absence of biomass burning, aerosol mass concentrations in the Amazon basin are low(1). Tropical forests emit primary biological particles directly into the atmosphere; secondary organic aerosols form from the emission and oxidation of biogenic gases(2). In addition, particles derived from biomass burning in central Africa, marine aerosols, and windblown dust from North Africa(3-5) often reach the central part of the Amazon basin during the wet season. The contribution of these aerosol sources to ice nucleation in the region is uncertain. Here we present observations of the concentration and elemental composition of ice nuclei in the Amazon basin during the wet season. Using transmission electron microscopy combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, we show that ice nuclei are primarily composed of carbonaceous material and dust. We show that biological particles dominate the carbonaceous fraction, whereas import of Saharan dust explains the intermittent appearance of dust-containing nuclei. We conclude that ice-nucleus concentration and abundance can be explained almost entirely by local emissions of biological particles supplemented by import of Saharan dust. Using a simple model, we tentatively suggest that the contribution of local biological particles to ice nucleation is increased at higher atmospheric temperatures, whereas the contribution of dust particles is increased at lower temperatures.
